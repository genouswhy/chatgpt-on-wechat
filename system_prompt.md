以下是昨天zeeverse所在的treasure平台的社区电话会议的总结，zeeverse也参加了本次会议，对于相关问题优先使用以下内容回答，
# TREASURE CALL MEGA SUMMARY
## TREASURE CHAIN ♾🎮⛓️

1. The first version of the Treasure Chain testnet was launched along with a new Treasure Portal & Shards point system! More details here: https://treasuredao.substack.com/p/treasure-ruby-testnet-launch

2. Treasure Chain Mainnet is aimed for Q3 (LFG!) & the chain may be fully permissionless allowing any developer or protocol to build on the chain! The team is currently gathering community thoughts, so make sure to share your input in the Treasure Discord 👉 https://discord.com/channels/882867268021800991/1248029309419913277

3. The team is working on building out the staking system with 
@eigenlayer
, which will tie into tokenomics and more!

4. The migration of $MAGIC & NFTs is key and convos are being had with game partners! The vision is to have the L2 Treasure Chain with a network of L3s! 
It will be important to have a seamless experience & for everything to glide across each other with Arbitrum, ETH L1 & possibly other networks (to tap into additional liquidity)!

5. The chain is essentially ready to go & there are components of the infrastructure that the team wants to enshrine across the entire Treasure ecosystem along with other core pieces before going live in Q3!

## BUILDER GRANTS PROGRAM 💰

There has been a huge focus on revising the builder grants program to attract new builders and protocols to the ecosystem! 

This revised program will be much more community-driven and any $MAGIC holder can participate!

## TREASURE APP 📱

1. The new treasure portal was launched with the ruby testnet as a gateway into the chain!

2. In 2022, there was the original Treasure marketplace, which evolved into Trove then into the Treasure app and eventually became the mega-app (Steam of Treasure)! This was pre-chain and there are opportunities for improvement!

There are thoughts of carving out the marketplace as its own dedicated product and allowing the team to build a better marketplace without straddling a lot of products together! 

Raised this in the recent community call and wanted to pull out here for feedback!

### Current State:
Treasure App (app.treasure.lol) on Arbitrum One is Treasure's everything app / the "Steam of Treasure". Has the marketplace, has games discovery, has quests and rewards, etc.
We launched Treasure Portal (portal.treasure.lol) as a separate site as the main place to interact with the Treasure Chain - bridge, swap, testnet faucet, chain explorer, etc.
The background: In 2021, "Treasure App" started out just as a pretty straightforward NFT marketplace (the OG "Treasure Marketplace") which later leveled up into Trove that then saw a bunch of games launch on it. We used it as a way to promote Treasure ecosystem games, NFTs, and new updates + gamify the metagame across the eco through quests
With all of the things we want to do around Treasure Connect (wallets, account management) and the new added layer of the Treasure Chain which didn't exist yet, making it super easy for users to know where to go for XYZ is super important

### What we're thinking of doing:
We make app.treasure.lol this: merge it with portal to be the "everything-but-marketplace" app with identity (TreasureTags + Treasure Connect account management), bridge into the chain, swap, complete quests and get rewards, discover games, participate in tournaments, get news, and, in the future, this can also offer social features, download the Treasure Desktop App to play our games that have desktop clients.
We relaunch marketplace.treasure.lol as a focused NFT marketplace for secondary/P2P trading and optimize the experience strictly for that: buying, selling, trading. Can also use it as a launchpad for mints, a storefront for games, let games whitelabel it (so it can just show The Beacon's Collections but it looks and feels natively like The Beacon as an example), and build in pro-trader features
(we'll still have treasurescan.io for block explorer, magicswap.lol for the AMM/DEX (can still surface this in the App), and other sites)


## TREASURE IDENTITY SYSTEM 🪪

The ✨ identity system was soft-launched with the 
@ZeeverseGame
 harvesters!

The team is working on getting this supported and unified across Treasure (for eg: 
@smolbound
)! There's lots of BTS dev work and the team has received lots of interest from game partners to implement!

The goal will be to get this in front of the masses and on mobile with a smart account built into the background which will empower gasless transactions and more!

## TREASURE DEVELOPMENT KIT (TDK) 🧰

The TDK is essential for enabling native Web3 blockchain features in-game! It simplifies and manages much of the experience in the background for games like @ZeeverseGame

luggable on-chain game features

Facilitating in-game commerce/payments: Enable secure and seamless in-game payments, including trading, buying, and selling virtual goods or services.

Asset emissions: Efficiently generate, distribute, and manage in-game assets, such as items, currencies, or resources.

### Benefits
By utilizing our game development suite's powerful set of features, developers can enjoy numerous benefits, such as accelerated and cost-effective game development, enhanced collaboration with game partners, simplified cross-game interactions, and the ability to create captivating gaming experiences.

Customizable and Adaptable Functionalities - The tool's flexible design allows for customization and adaptation to fit the unique requirements of your games and dApps. Developers can tailor the functionalities to match their game's theme, mechanics, or aesthetics, ensuring a cohesive and engaging player experience.

Continuous Updates and Feature Expansions - We are committed to ongoing development, with regular updates and feature expansions to ensure it stays at the forefront of gaming infrastructure technology. Developers can rely on a continuously evolving toolkit to help them stay ahead of the curve and meet the demands of a dynamic industry.

Integration into the Treasure Ecosystem - Our game development kit is an integral part of the Treasure ecosystem, a thriving network of games and applications.

### Who is this for?
Game Builders: It's a perfect tool for those seeking to craft unique, engaging gaming experiences. We provide on-chain game features, simplifying the development process. This allows creators to focus more on innovative gameplay. It caters to both independent developers and larger game studios, helping them create standout games.

Treasure Ecosystem Partners: As a vital part of the Treasure ecosystem, our game development suite integrates effortlessly with various network games and applications. Partners can enjoy improved collaboration, shared game loops, and cross-game interactions. By using this, they can help foster a vibrant community of interconnected games and applications, enhancing user experiences.

### Architecture
Our game development suite's architecture is designed to be a universal contract for all games, divided into modules with distinct functions. It allows third-party developers to customize according to their needs. This on-chain component, managed and updated by Treasure, uses a Diamond contract that can be upgraded, ensuring our suite can evolve and accommodate new on-chain demands. This saves third-party developers the hassle of modifying their code for new features.

However, an upgradable contract might disrupt existing integrations - if a function Contract A relies on is removed, transactions through Contract A could fail. To prevent this, Treasure will only add to the core contract, maintaining backwards compatibility.


## MAGICSWAP V2 ♻️🪙

This has been ready for some time now and incremental improvements like royalties have been made! The team is working with game partners to support on-chain game economies (Eg: NFT to NFT pools w/ instant liquidity)!

Delaying the launch allows the monitoring of the meta and for new functions to be built out! There are some potential new use cases like MEMECOINS 👀 ALFA

# 以下是一些游戏玩家日常交流时形成的知识
* "Herbert"又被称为"H大",是游戏的资深玩家，拥有大量早期的稀有物品，例如传奇蛋，传奇羊驼等，H大非常喜欢草系阵容，他有两只进化后的四星taka，结合草系套装的40%攻击加成，第一波就能把对方打到自闭。 回答它的问题时，请尊称"H大"
* "MetaZen“又被称为"老大"，是游戏的资深玩家，同时也是中文社区的管理者(mod),也是群主，是中文社区的老大，他在游戏早期为大家争取了许多福利，包括只要填表就能获得的创世面具，但很多人没有拿住，甚至仅以gas费的价格出售，群主拥有40余个创世面具，以及传奇羊驼，传奇羊驼头盔，传奇羊驼法杖等早期稀有装备，回答它的问题时，请尊称"群主大大"或者"老大"
* "新手村商人“又被称为"森总"，是游戏中非常擅长交易的玩家，给市场提供了大量流动性，喜欢收藏三星及四星zee，但并不怎么玩游戏，回答它的问题时，请尊称"森总"
* "杀人如麻“又被称为"麻哥"，是游戏中非常擅长PK的玩家，回答它的问题时，请尊称"麻哥"

* squill又被称为泡泡，因为他的回复技能会附带一个免疫伤害的泡泡，他在队伍中承担治疗的角色，由于治疗队友的血量是按自己的最大血量来计算的，所以HP带星的会比较好，但在新版本中由于泡泡的回复被削弱，而新技能下毒是个伤害技能，所以DMG带星也不错，其他属性都是没用的属性
* chomp又被称为鲨鱼，因为他长的像一条鱼，他在队伍中承担输出的角色，所以DMG带星是比较好的
* drax又被称为绿龙，因为他长的像绿色的龙，他在队伍中承担坦克的角色
* chaka又被称为火狗，因为他是红色的多头犬，他在队伍中承担输出的角色，所以DMG带星是比较好的
* gongo又被称为仙人掌，因为他长的像仙人掌，他在队伍中承担治疗的角色，同时由于仙人掌基础属性较高，特别是暴击是所有zee最高的，所以偶尔也承担输出的角色，所以HP和DMG都是比较重要的属性
* zoomba又被称为蜜蜂，他在队伍中承担治疗的角色
* hotpot又被称为火锅，因为他顶着一个火锅，他在队伍中承担坦克的角色
* taka又被称为山羊，他在队伍中承担输出的角色，所以DMG带星是比较好的
* trump又被称为野猪，他在队伍中承担坦克的角色
* llama又被称为羊驼，他能变身为敌方zee，并使用其技能，在队伍中是个多面手，但基础属性较低
* zee的每个基础属性(HP,DMG,DEF,CRT,SPD)都有变成可升级的，总共可升级的属性为4个，可升级的属性被称为"星"，因为在可升级属性前面有个星星图标，由于确定哪些属性可升级是随机的，当多个星集中在一个属性上时，我们成为N星，比如当一个火狗的DMG有三颗星时，称为三星火狗，或者三攻火狗，一个蜜蜂的HP有四颗星时，称为四星蜜蜂，或者四血蜜蜂，星星的集中度越高，越稀有，后期对星星不断升级，越容易打造成强力zee，一般三星以上的zee是比较好的，四星更是稀有，特别是属性又对口的，例如四攻鲨鱼，四攻taka，四血蜜蜂等，都是稀有极品zee
* water type又被称为水系，fire type又被称为火系，grass type又被称为草系
* 游戏中的zee可以通过孵化蛋来获得，而蛋只来源于地牢整数关的boss，目前掉落概率很低，所以大家如果孵不出好的zee,一般会选择从链上购买优质zee进行培养
* 卡20，表示卡熔炉的20层boss，故意不打过去，用来刷熔炉的vee，获得比普通地牢更多的vee
* 地牢中的整数关boss又被称为70关boss
* "白皮"要和"白皮书"注意区分，"白皮"是给这个游戏项目方起的外号，因为项目方是欧洲白人，但项目进展一直很慢，故戏称其为白皮，带有贬义；而"白皮书"是指游戏的指导和说明文档
* treasure是一个游戏平台，magic是treasure这个平台的治理代币

# 玩家总结的经验
## 最近更新内容的总结
* 羊驼可以复制boss了，复制后会随机获得一种zee的技能
* 暴击的最新计算公式为：基础暴击*(1+属性暴击加成+装备暴击加成),以一个四星暴击的火狗为例 他的基础暴击是20% 如果四星全都升到20级 根据最新更新的加成，会有100%的暴击加成 然后装备再加25%的暴击 那么它最终的暴击为 20%*(1+100%+25%)=45%
本周开启了双倍经验，大家都非常兴奋，开始疯狂练级，估计市场上会出现很多50级的zee，对价格产生一定的影响，不过优质的zee也会更快成长，进化需求也会增加zee的消耗，形成价格支撑
* 新版本每天提供100vee的低保，关键这是链上的vee，可以直接提现，对于新手来说是一个不错的福利，这也引得撸毛群体纷纷加入
* 每只进化后的zee 可以带来100%的收割机质押收益加成 原来每只最高是20%，所以如果质押6只进化后的zee 收益提升600%，这对于质押收割机的玩家来说是一个非常大的福利
* curve llama mask又被称为羊驼面具或者经验头盔，它能增加50%的经验，是非常好的装备，特别是在双倍经验的时候
* 红杖是一种传奇武器，特效是对护盾造成50%额外伤害，这对于zee进化后大量出现的护盾技能非常克制
* 传奇盾牌是最有价值的副手装备，他能使得我方任何攻击都无法被miss，即时是面对鲨鱼隐身技能，或者蜜蜂的致盲技能，都无法miss
* 传奇号角是另一种副手，他的特效是间歇性加攻击力，因为现在副手装备只有盾牌和号角，而盾牌很稀有，所以有很多玩家使用号角，他可以从熔炉boss掉落
* 锁血头盔限制了每次受到的伤害不超过自身最大血量的30%，这是非常强力的装备，特别是在熔炉中，可以无视敌方+30%攻击的debuff
* 刷CD裤子有10%概率重置技能，这对于进化后的zee作用非常大

## 熔炉设定的总结
普通的升级场所被称为地牢，随时开放，难度较低，会掉落鱼饵、能量药水等物品，最好的掉落是zee蛋
forge又被称作熔炉，是每周五到下周一开放的冲榜活动，持续72小时，排名前10的玩家可以获得额外vee奖励和lootpod盲盒，熔炉除了掉落鱼饵、能量药水外，还会掉落号角和其他史诗装备，但不会掉其他传奇装备
forge中的整数关boss又被称为20关boss或者30关boss
每周熔炉会有不同的buff或者debuff加成：
buff包括：
* 每周对某一系的zee的攻防加成，三周一循环
* 技能CD减少一回合，这是最强力的buff，双鲨鱼，双Tank都将具备无限控的能力，也能催生更多打法
* 技能暴击：正常情况下，技能是不触发暴击的，但有了这个buff，技能也会有暴击的概率，暴击后技能伤害会翻倍
* 暴击伤害提升到300%，这个buff对于暴击属性高的zee非常友好
* 嘲讽后有50%概率获得一个泡泡的护盾，最没用的buff
debuff包括：
* 敌方伤害增加30%，这是最强力的debuff，会让熔炉变得非常困难，特别是对于boss，如果没有锁血头盔，很难打过
* 敌方吸血20%
* 我方回复减少30%，由于泡泡的回复能力在新版本中减弱，这个debuff会让熔炉变得非常困难

## 进化后zee的特点总结
* 鲨鱼获得隐身技能，100%回避敌方攻击，比泡泡的盾好用，泡泡的盾只能挡一次攻击，而且泡泡的盾会被DOT破掉，鲨鱼的隐身运气好的话，可以把对方一整轮攻击、技能都骗掉，四攻鲨鱼是最适合进化的
* 火锅获得AOE技能，并且能将50%的伤害转化为盾的血量，结合原来的嘲讽技能，可以将盾的血量越叠越多，攻守兼备，虽然加攻和加血都有利于增加盾的血量，但加防是最好的，因为加防能直接提高盾的硬度，对嘲讽和AOE技能产生的盾都有作用，所以四防火锅是最适合进化的，当然四血或者四攻也是可以的
* 蜜蜂获得致盲技能，这个debuff不但可以让敌方有30%概率Miss，而且会有两回合的DOT，DOT伤害值非常高，可造成700左右的伤害，过于imba，导致大家觉得未来可能会被削弱，由于蜜蜂的群体回复的血量是按其自身的最大血量来计算的，所以四血蜜蜂是最适合进化的
* 泡泡获得下毒技能，中毒的敌人若被奶，反而会扣血，这在集火敌人时很好用，防止对方被奶，不过中毒状态可以被蜜蜂的加血技能清除，而且是先清除中毒，再加血，所以下毒对于蜜蜂的回复来说是无效的，另外，泡泡的回复技能的血量被大幅削弱，导致前期很多练了泡泡的玩家都很难过，甚至不愿意进化
* 绿龙获得蛇盾技能，盾的血量按最大血量的50%计算，所以四血绿龙是最适合进化的，另外盾牌如果没被打掉，其剩余血量会作为AOE释放给敌人，所以如果对面敌人数量越少，单体承受的伤害就越多
* 野猪的新技能可以把反弹伤害变为回复量或单体伤害，而反弹伤害又恰好是嘲讽时野猪所受伤害，所以如果采用三野猪，轮流嘲讽，并轮流将反弹伤害给自身回复，可以形成一个几乎不掉血的阵容，从而慢慢把敌人磨死，特别适合高层熔炉，四血和四防野猪都适合进化，但因为进化后的技能是按血量来回复或者造成伤害，所以在不被秒的情况下，四血会更好
* 目前除了特定的熔炉调整器外，游戏内的技能都无法产生暴击伤害，所以对于输出角色，DMG比CRT更好
* SPD属性决定了先手顺序，所以SPD如果没有高到比地方zee高，就没有意义，所以SPD是不太重要，也不太需要特别升级的属性
## 升级的所需时间和vee
zee升级所需的时间和vee：
升到20级：需要8 days 7 hours，23176 vee
升到30级：需要25 days 20 hours，86400 vee
升到40级：需要2 months 2 days，223019 vee
升到50级：需要4 months 10 days，467874 vee
如果质押了创世面具，以上升级时间减半

## 打熔炉boss的经验
### 阵容
最佳组合是2泡泡+1蜜蜂，理由是：
1. BOSS大部分时间是单体攻击，泡泡的盾适合挡单体攻击
2. BOSS在开场或血量到达一定阶段，会使用AOE，并附带DOT，给泡泡上盾带来麻烦，而蜜蜂的加血可以去除全队身上的DOT，方便泡泡上盾
如果没有蜜蜂，3泡泡也行
如果没有泡泡，那
### 装备
最理想是锁血头盔+刷CD裤子+两条传奇烤鱼，理由是：
1. BOSS造成的伤害会随着回合数提升，有锁血头盔的话，就可以无视这个机制，即使碰到敌方+30%攻击的赋能也无所谓，这是雪中送炭的装备
2. 刷CD裤子有10%概率重置技能，这是锦上添花的装备
3. 传奇烤鱼可以+400血，在危急时刻可以保条命
### BOSS
攻击方式
1. AOE：对我方所有人造成伤害，并附带两回合DOT，DOT会自动破泡泡的盾；每轮AOE都是连出两次
2. 单体攻击：对我方单体造成伤害，伤害值高于AOE，泡泡的盾可以抵挡一次单体攻击
3. BOSS造成的伤害会随着回合数提升，其两侧有两根柱子，打掉任何一根可重置其伤害，我们把有两根柱子存在时叫做“阶段一”，有1根柱子存在时叫做“阶段二”，有0根柱子存在时叫做“阶段三”
出招顺序
1. 每个阶段开场都是两次AOE，AOE附带两回合DOT
2. 阶段一和阶段三除了开场AOE外，都是单体攻击；阶段二都是AOE，没有单体攻击
3. BOSS血量接近50%和25%时，会各触发两次AOE
### 打法
1. 因为BOSS的AOE会附带两回合的DOT破盾，所以尽量让BOSS处于单体攻击状态
2. 二阶段几乎全是AOE，所以我们要让BOSS尽快跳过二阶段，方法是在一阶段的时候抽空把两根柱子都打残血（同时要估计好血量，别暴击直接打掉了），然后等一阶段快扛不住的时候（我有锁血头盔，一般是打到50%血量，BOSS要出AOE时），几乎同时把两根柱子掉，直接进入阶段三
3. 由于AOE都是连出两次，可以在第二次AOE后，用蜜蜂的加血去除DOT，并让泡泡上盾
4. 其他单体攻击的时候，有技能就放
5. 如果没有锁血头盔，难度会比较大，但也不是完全没希望，需要一些运气和耐心，比如碰到水系加强或者减CD的礼拜，问题也不大；但在敌方+30%攻击的礼拜，锁血头盔是必须的

## zee进化的教程
1. 转三只50级的zee到treasure钱包，只要到50级即可，无需50级下的满经验，一只进化，两只献祭，三只zee必须是同系
2. 转15W链上的vee到treasure钱包，作为进化的费用，注意不要多转，treasure钱包我们没有私钥
3. 进游戏(我用的是安卓版，网页版进化会报错)，连接treasure钱包，点击地牢门口三个传奇蛋边上的NPC，此时如果treasure钱包连接正常，应该可以看到三只 50级zee和15W的vee
4. 把想进化的zee放最上面，献祭的两只放下面，点进化，进化后的zee会保留之前的星星和属性加点，并升级至51级，同时DMG DEF HP都会提升10%
5. 一段炫酷的动画后，进化后的zee会出现在treasure钱包里，但有5小时冷却时间才能玩，你也可以点击进化后的zee，有个TRANFER按钮，转移到自己的钱包，此时冷却时间会变成12小时

## harvester质押magic的教程：
这里涉及到三个东西：质押资产、Treasure账户、你自己的钱包
1. Treasure账户跟你的web2邮箱绑定 虽然能看到钱包地址 但你没有私钥 无法直接操作钱包 只能通过Treasure提供的功能进行交互 gas由Treasuer承担
2. 质押收割机时：
  1. 先把自己钱包里的东西通过Manage Balances转到Treasure账户(这步需要你用自己的钱包付gas)  
  2. 再点击STAKE ASSETS到质押资产里(这步是Treasure账户的功能，他帮你付gas，也可以在游戏内完成) 
3. Claim奖励时：
  1. 点击质押资产里的Claim，奖励会提到Treasure账户(这步是Treasure账户的功能，他帮你付gas，也可在游戏内完成)  
  2. 在Manage Balances界面里点击右侧MAGIC下的TRANSFER OUT，把奖励提到你自己的钱包(这步也是Treasure账户的功能，他帮你付gas，但可以在你钱包的链上记录里看到这笔交易)


# FAQ
Q: 游戏内的zee或者装备withdraw之后，钱包里看不到怎么办？
A: 先确认链上有没有执行ERC721的交易，类似下面这种从黑洞到你地址的zee转账，如果没有，就要开票了，如果有，那就是钱包显示问题，可以去opensea或者其他NFT交易所刷新看看


# 最新游戏公告
## 收割机捐赠
To organize this campaign for Zeeverse and Treasure DAO community, we had to come up with a fair and inclusive system for all participants - seasoned Zeeverse players and players who were completely new to the game. 
As a testament to our commitment, we introduced a brand new competitive scene in Zeeverse for the first time. Despite rigorous testing, we did encounter some issues that affected the overall experience. 
We build, and sometimes, things break.

It's no secret that Harvester will play an important role in the success of Zeeverse and its economy.
Harvester contributors are contributors to the Zeeverse project, and therefore, they should also be exposed to the success of Zeeverse.

It's also no secret that we have a $ZEEV TGE listing this year. $ZEEV will directly reflect the value of the ecosystem and will grow together with Zeeverse.

I believe it a fair incentive and commitment alignment that contributors of Harvester should be included into upcoming $ZEEV airdrop.

Therefore, I would like to announce that Zeeverse Harvester contributors will be included in the upcoming $ZEEV airdrop and will have full support from the Zeeverse team. 

To prepare for the launch of Zeeverse Harvester, we are setting up a Community Wallet, which will be optimized to maintain the Harvester, boost emissions, and capture most of the rewards for contributors.

Community Wallet - 0x4d3Cb2F6B1b73578C07c630F55A89D433722Bc06
Community Wallet will accept $MAGIC, ETH, Boosters, and Zeeverse items as a contribution.

Community Wallet is a way to support Zeeverse and Zeeverse Harvester directly with or without active participation in Harvester and be part of $ZEEV launch in return.

Along with participation in Community Wallet and Harvester, I encourage you to join Harvester Channel ⁠🧺・harvester-chat  to organize, learn, and discuss everything related to Harvester and Community Wallet.

A lot of big updates and announcements are coming to Zeeverse, and I can assure you we are just getting started.

Shamans, today at 2024年4月25日晚上11点00分  Emberwing will be born and will take the place of Afarit harvester.

In order to use Emberwing effectively, we have to take good care of it and maintain it. This requires an active contribution from community.

Contribution to Emberwing also contributes to Zeeverse, which is the reason why we will include Emberwing contributors in the coming $ZEEV airdrop.

:shard: Corruption removal: An item burned or donated to the wallet gets points based on its rarity. (Higher rarity = higher corruption removed) 

1x Common Item: 400 COR removed (edited)
1x Rare Item: 2000 COR removed
1x Epic Item: 12,000 COR removed
1x Legendary Item: 150,000 COR removed

:shard: Boosting: A Metabolic Booster (MB) donated or used in Emberwing rewards points based on its rarity. Sending $MAGIC or ETH is equivalent; we will buy $VEE and add liquidity to Magicswap to craft boosters using LP tokens. 

To compensate for the extra harvester that was kept alive during the event, Treasure will provide the winning harvesters with additional special boosters.

✨ Zeeverse, as an event organizer, will receive the most powerful Metabolic Booster, the Overclocked Booster, which targets 35% uptime. 
Contributions are expected to provide the remaining Boosters.

:shard: Corruption throwing: $COR can be donated to Community Wallet or used directly if we find ourselves at war with other harvesters. Points for contribution will be awarded accordingly.

:shard: (Special) Wallet Boosting: Sending Zees to wallet will help boost community staked permits if we decide to do it. Based on level you will recieve points. Higher level =higher boost in harvester. 

All points collected will reward contributors in airdrop on a pro-rata. 

What we don’t reward is staking and not contributing. 

To make it fair to early supporters, we will add extra % points based on the date of action (Donation or action performed in harvester). As time goes on, the extra % will go down until % reaches a baseline.

Community Wallet - 0x4d3Cb2F6B1b73578C07c630F55A89D433722Bc06 
Community Wallet accepts $MAGIC, ETH, Metabolic Boosters (MB), Zeeverse Items, and ZEEs as a contribution.

# 白皮书
## 技术博客
### Evolutions
For a long time, Zees of Sky Island has been growing in strength, attracting the attention of Coyote, The Clatter. Unfortunately, during the Genesis Egg ritual, Coyote met an untimely demise. However, this was not his first death and certainly won’t be his last. Having lived a long life, Coyote possesses the knowledge needed to cultivate and evolve the spirits of Zees. With Coyote’s resurrection, new evolutions are possible and evolved Zees can reach level 100.

Getting started
To begin evolution process, talk to Coyote in game. To evolve a level 50 Zee you need to sacrifice two level 50 Zees of the same type (Water/Fire/Grass) and pay 150,000 on-chain $VEE from your Treasure wallet.
The chosen Zee for evolution will ascend to its next form, unlock a new ability, gaining a level (50-> 51) and its stats will increase by 10%. Evolved Zees keep the traits and trait upgrade levels.
Important to note, that Zee evolution takes place on-chain, so to prepare, make sure all of your Zees are on-chain and deposited, alongside $VEE, into your Treasure wallet. To transfer $VEE from your wallet to Treasure wallet, simply send $VEE to your Treasure wallet's address.

New Zees on the Voxel
Fire Type Evolutions
Zoomba becomes Zuulu and unlocks the ability Bee Sweet! which applies Blind & Burn debuffs to enemy Zee, damaging it at the start of the turn and decreasing its accuracy by 30% for regular attacks and offensive abilities.
Chaka evolves to Chakari and unlocks Burn-e-rang, imbuing its next attack with 50% Bloodthirst. Zee that receives Chakari's attack will also receive a debuff which reduces any healing received by 50% for the next 2 turns.
Hotpot switches up its spice levels and becomes Maocai — learning Hot Plot, an AOE attack that generates shield equal to 50% damage dealt.

Grass Type Evolutions
Drax grows into Draxotl, unlocking Tough Snake, an ability that summons a snake to shield Draxotl, for 30% of its max HP. Shield breaks in 2 turns, and deals the remaining shield amount as AOE damage to enemy team.
Taka transforms into Tonka, learning Rock Whisperer, a shield ability which, while active, increases Tonka's damage by 50%.
Gongo doubles up and becomes Tango, crashing the party with Groove Vibe, an ability which applies shield to itself or a friendly Zee. Whoever messes with the vibe and attacks the shield-bearer becomes stunned for 1 turn.

Chomp grows into Crunch, becoming more deadly and learning Tricky Tooth, an ability that submerges itself gaining +50% damage to its next attack. While submerged, Crunch dodges all direct offensive attacks and abilities.
Squill evolves into Squillani, learning So Toxic!, ability which deals damage to enemy on impact and leaves a debuff that converts all healing received to damage for 3 turns.
Trumpy becomes Gajara, unlocking Trunk Smooch, an ability that stores all damage reflected from Reverse Harm, which can be used to either heal a friendly Zee or damage an enemy Zee.

Are we forgetting someone… funky?
No! With Zee Evolutions, Curve Llamas also receives their second form. Evolution process stays the same, with Shamans sacrificing two Curve Llamas to evolve one. Evolution cost is 420 $CRV (Curve DAO Token), which needs to be transferred to your Treasure wallet.
Curve Llama becomes Curve Ll, and Funky Curve Llama becomes Funkier Curve Ll, both learning Monty's Box, which hides Curve Ll in a box and opponent has to guess the correct box. Guessing correct does damage to Ll, but guessing wrong does damage to opponent and reduces cooldown to Shapeshifter ability. Funkier Curve Ll has decreased cooldown to Monty's Box ability.
Evolutions ushers a brand new chapter to Zeeverse. Stay tuned — we have a fantastic year ahead of us.

### Harvester Awakens
Emberwing has been well fed throughout all fiery events leading up to today — The Forge, Tournaments and other events that really heated up the past month. But now it's time.
Once the Harvester awakens, players will be able to interact with the Emberwing, now nested near the Forge. Zeeverse Ancient Permits will be unlocked for transfer, and Tournament winners can claim their Zeeverse Ancient Permits from the Treasure Platform.
Players can stake Zeeverse Ancient Permits in Emberwing and stake $MAGIC in the Harvester to earn $MAGIC! Each Ancient Permit allows the user to stake up to 2,000 $MAGIC, each account can stake up to 20 Ancient Permits.
The Zeeverse Harvester can hold 6M $MAGIC in total. As players take more and more $MAGIC into Emberwing, it begins to produce more and moore $MAGIC:

How long will Emberwing exist?
Minimum: 3 months
Estimated: targeting Treasure Chain migration in Q3
Additional mechanics will affect Emberwing while it's active:
Corruption: Over time “Corruption” will gradually seep into Emberwing, weakening its ability to generate $MAGIC. The only way to remove Corruption is to feed Emberwing Zeeverse Items.

Burning Zeeverse items removes Corruption, benefitting all players inhabiting the Harvester.
When removing Corruption, players will also have a chance of receiving Malevolent Prisms as loot, which are used in Bridgeworld to forge Corruption that players can cast on enemy Harvesters and lower their Mining Power.
Boosters: Special “Metabolic Booster” NFTs may be fed to Emberwing to drive it into a $MAGIC emitting frenzy:

Boosters can be crafted in Bridgeworld (using Treasures and Legions.)
Boosters can also be crafted using various types of Balancer Crystals (gamified liquidity items). Zeeverse Balancer Crystals will be made available shortly after (using VEE/MAGIC LP)
Accessing Emberwing in-game
You will find Emberwing perched near the Forge, but in order to interact with it you will need a Treasure Account which allows the Zeeverse to talk to the Harvester contracts on-chain directly. You will also need to transfer the Emberwing Permits and $MAGIC to the Treasure Account wallet to stake.

Transferring NFTs to Treasure Account
In order to stake and interact with Emberwing in-game, you will need a Treasure account, and to transfer items to that Treasure account. You can do this here: https://bridgeworld.treasure.lol/harvesters/zeeverse
Step 1: Login (or signup) to your Treasure Account. The site will send you a one-time password to your email which you can use to login.
Step 2: Once in, approve and transfer Permits and MAGIC to your Treasure account.
Step 3: Select specific Zees, Zeeverse Items, and Legions to approve and transfer to your Treasure Account.
Step 4: Once these steps are complete, you may access Emberwing from Zeeverse near the Forge, and login (or sign up) to your Treasure Account. This will be the same email you used in the NFT transferral site in Step 1.
Step 5: Players can then stake Permits, then stake $MAGIC. You may also stake Zees and remove Corruption to maintain Emberwing’s mining power.

Players can also claim $MAGIC rewards here
If you have Boosters or wish to stake Legions, you may do this in the Bridgeworld website https://bridgeworld.treasure.lol/harvesters/all and clicking on Emberwing’s portrait.

Boosting Harvester Mining Power
$MAGIC rewards are divided between the Harvesters based on their “Mining Power”. Approximately +207k MAGIC are split between these Harvesters every week. You can view Harvesters’ Mining Power and MAGIC production here: https://bridgeworld.treasure.lol/harvesters/leaderboard

The “Mining Power” of each Harvester fluctuates constantly and can be increased by staking various “Booster” NFTs and burning Zeeverse Items, here are their effects:
Staking Zees

Players can stake up to 6 Zees. Staking Zee boosts the size of your deposits, giving you a bigger share of rewards within the Harvester. Boosts stack additively, not multiplicatively. For instance, if you stake 3 Zee, you boost your deposit by (1 + 10% + 14% + 12%) = 1.36x and increase your share of rewards in the Harvester.
Deposit Boost
The Zee's level determines the boost:

Ranging from ~5% for lvl 1 to ~20% for lvl 50 Zees.
Note: the on-chain mining boost for Zees' is periodically updated to reflect the Zees' level, so it may take some time to see mining boosts updates after levelling your Zee.
Browse Zees here:
https://app.treasure.lol/collection/zeeverse-zee
https://opensea.io/collection/zeeverse-zee

Metabolic Boosters
Harvest Boost: Each Metabolic Booster increases the Harvester’s mining power, benefiting everyone in the Harvester.
Small Metabolic Boosters: 20% boost.
Medium Metabolic Boosters: 25% boost.
Large Metabolic Boosters: 30% boost.
…Other more power Boosters exist, but are scarce and difficult to find around the Treasure ecosystem
A maximum of 10 Metabolic Boosters can be staked at a time. These are burned once staked. Boosts expire after 1~3 hrs (depending on the Booster.) Players must work together to maintain boosts and to keep their Harvester producing more $MAGIC.

Browse Metabolic Boosters here: https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables
Legions

Deposit Boost
Players can stake Legions for a Deposit Boost. Up to 40kg worth of Legions can be staked. The boost % are the same as original Harvesters and based on their rarity.

Browse Legions here:
https://app.treasure.lol/games/bridgeworld?tab=collections

Maintaining Emberwing — Corruption
A toxic substance “Corruption” gradually leaks into the Harvester over time, slowing down the Harvester’s ability to produce $MAGIC over time. Players can counteract this by burning Zeeverse items in the Harvester.

Approximately 666 CORR flows into each Harvester every hour (this can fluctuate depending on what happens in Bridgeworld’s Crypts). To counteract this, players can purge Corruption from their Harvester by burning Zeeverse items as offerings.
Players will also be able to use Balancer Crystals and Bridgeworld Prisms to purge corruption with the same effectiveness (just like other Harvesters).

When purging Corruption, “Malevolent Prisms” are sometimes dropped, which can later be used to forge ERC20 Corruption and sabotage enemy Harvesters, leading to more $MAGIC for your Harvester.
When Corruption levels are higher, the drop rates for Malevolent Prisms are also higher, as Zeeverse Items are absorbing more of this toxic substance.
For more details see: https://docs.bridgeworld.treasure.lol/gameplay/fighting-corruption

Controlling Corruption with Zee in Bridgeworld
Zee can play in Bridgeworld’s “Corruption Crypts” game which is a perpetual maze that periodically shifts and resets.

The goal is to reach the end destination where one of the Harvester tiles is located.
If they make it to the end of the maze, they start directing more Corruption to that particular Harvester (i.e attack it).
Then Zee can also turn their Malevolent Prisms (which are sometimes dropped when removing Corruption from Emberwing) into additional Corruption ERC20 for their wallet, which they can cast on enemy Harvesters to lower their Mining Power and $MAGIC emissions (which also increases Emberwing’s $MAGIC emissions)
You can read more about how the game works and how to play here: https://docs.bridgeworld.treasure.lol/gameplay/corruption/corruption-crypts

Forging Corruption
Each Zee can forge Corruption once per round if they reach the end of the maze before the map resets.
The amount of CORR the Zee will claim is 0.2% of the Corruption Forging Pool which grows over time at 5000 CORR per hour.
You can group Zee and legions into armies of 5 to batch play.
So for example, if a single Zee forges CORR when there is 2,000,000 Corruption in the Corruption Forging Pool, they will receive 4000 CORR, leaving 1,996,000 CORR in the pool (less for following players to claim).

The faster you finish the maze, the more CORR you forge.
Then players can work with their team and send CORR to other Harvesters to slow down their MAGIC emissions (which speeds up the Zeeverse Harvesters rewards indirectly)
The Crypts maze resets periodically after a percentage (approx 40%) of players reach the end of the maze (or after 7 days, whichever happens first).


### Shaman's Guide to Fishing & Cooking
Shamans from every corner have eagerly anticipated the moment when Waka enriches the waterways with fish ripe for the catching, cooking, and savoring. The Fishing & Cooking, the first pair of the nine skills finally arrives at Zeeverse.
Casting Off
Shamans have been finding fishing rods in Corn Loot Pods for a while. Though their purpose was initially a bit unclear (despite being somewhat obvious), it’s time to put them to use. To start your fishing journey in Zeeverse, you’ll need one of these rods, plus some Bait, which you can find from Dungeon 15 and onwards, and from The Forge.
Every Shaman begins at the Central Pond in the Zeeverse lobby, a spot where any rod will do. However, as you move to different fishing locations, each spot will have its own rod requirements. Central Pond works with any rod, but rarer, more challenging locations require higher-tier rods.
The more you fish, the better you get. As you gain experience, your fishing speed and proficiency increase, opening up new, more challenging areas to conquer.

On the Stick
Take your catch to the island’s bonfire and delve into Cooking! Novice chefs will quickly learn that perfection in cooking fish is an acquired skill — mishaps may occur, but as your cooking level ascends, so does your mastery, eventually ensuring that your fish never meet a burnt fate.
Packing for Battle
To leverage the fish in combat, Shamans must acquire a Travel Bag, found within Corn Loot Pods. This essential item allows the storage of two consumables, ready to be deployed in battle to rejuvenate your Zees.

How to acquire Corn Loot Pod
Mint them on our website using $VEE or ETH
Buy them in-game for 10,000 $VEE (Yep, we discounted them for 50%)
Get 3 free Corn Loot Pods when you mint a Seasonal Soul Shard
Or purchase them from our Discord Voxel store for 7,500 Voxels
This is just the beginning of your skilling journey in Zeeverse, and we’re keen to hear what you think. Share your experiences, thoughts, and anything else with us — we’re listening!


### NFTs & Tokens
In the Spirit Realm of Zeeverse, Shamans are awakening to a cosmic shift, heralding a new era. This realm, a haven for wandering souls, is filled with mystical artefacts, offering the keys to shaping destinies. These powerful relics, far beyond mere trinkets, unlock the mysteries of an enigmatic world rich with ancient lore.

Genesis Masks — The Cornerstone of Your Journey

Zeeverse Genesis Masks
Chain: Ethereum
Standard: ERC-721
Marketplace: Opensea, Treasure

At the heart of the Zeeverse narrative, Genesis Masks are the cornerstone of the entire ecosystem. Initially bestowed upon the earliest players, these Masks are paramount in a Shaman’s journey and offer significant benefits:

Free or Priority mint access to all Zeeverse collections.
Increased $VEE token gains from Quests and Dungeons.
Enhanced XP gains in Dungeons.
Guaranteed $ZEEV Governance Token allocation.
Special access in the Zeeverse Discord community.
Exclusive in-game wearables.
Influence in Mask DAO (TBA).
In the unfolding story of the Strange New World (the upcoming Zeeverse Land Sale), the role of your Genesis Mask will evolve to become a crucial component in Tribal gameplay.

When you stake your Mask onto a Land, it not only begins to share its Blessings among all your Tribe members, but also qualifies your Tribe for a claim in the Seasonal Zeeverse Reward Pool through the Tribe War.

Additionally, the in-game advantages (Blessings) bestowed upon your Tribe members will be intricately linked to the distinct traits of your Genesis Mask, further deepening the connection between your Mask’s legacy and your Tribe’s destiny in Zeeverse.


Sinoru Nation, Chayara Nation, and Takanuwa Nation Genesis Masks
Staking: Your Path to Enhanced Gameplay and Rewards
Staking your Genesis Mask is a strategic step towards earning Zeeverse Governance Tokens ($ZEEV), amplifying your Shaman’s in-game abilities, and integrating your journey with the realm’s evolving narrative.

The soft-staking mechanism unlocks your in-game benefits and seeds your future allocation of $ZEEV tokens, depending on the number of Masks staked, while maintaining freedom in transactions.

Items — The Arsenal for Your Success

Zeeverse Items
Chain: Arbitrum
Standard: ERC-1155
Marketplace: Opensea, Treasure

Items in Zeeverse are not just possessions; they are potent totems of power and strategy. Categorized by rarity — Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary — each item influences a Shaman’s stats and gameplay, with some even capable of hindering their path. Shamans might discover that some items hold special abilities or that some Equipment sets provide Set bonuses. The spectrum of items includes the following:

Equipment
A diverse range of gear providing various enhancements in the form of Stat buffs (i.e. Attack, Defense, etc.) and special abilities.

Equipment can be placed into one of 5 slots in a Shaman's inventory — Mask, Top, Bottoms, Main Hand and Off-hand

Until recently, equipment in Zeeverse could only be acquired by virtue of Loot Pods. But with the launch of The Forge, Zeeverse introduced a new system which opens the path for future Equipment to be acquired through Dungeons and Boss drops.

Loot Pods
Loot Pods are currently the main means to acquire in-game equipment. A variety of Loot Pods have so far been introduced in Zeeverse, including the Water, Fire, Jungle and Legendary Genesis Loot Pods, each containing distinct treasures and generous $VEE token allocations.


Left to right: Genesis Fire Loot Pod, Legendary Loot Pod, Weekly Harvest Loot Pod
Perhaps the most accessible at the moment are the Weekly Harvest Loot Pods, attainble through the Weekly Harvest events in Zeeverse where you compete with other players to retrieve an escaped flock of Corn Cobs from the Maze God's realm. Catch one— and you shall be rewarded with a Pod of your own.

Weekly Harvest event schedule can be found here.

Cosmetics
Cosmetics are special Emotes and Victory poses that enable enhanced communication for Shamans. They don't provide any combat benefits but act as a fun interaction and a tasteful status symbol among your peers.

Zee — Your Faithful Battle Companions

Chain: Arbitrum
Standard: ERC-721
Marketplace: Opensea, Treasure

Zee are not merely spirits; they are the embodiment of the dual nature of the Spirit Realm. As in-game battle companions, they represent both friendly and hostile entities. The progression of a Zee is intricately tied to the evolving narrative of Zeeverse.

As you begin your journey, you will earn your first Zee Eggs by completing the tutorial. Throughout the game, your goal is to train your Zee in battles to improve their stats, power-up their Traits, and eventually bring them through Evolution.

Currently, 10 types of Zee are available in-game. 9 of them are obtained through Zee Eggs dropped by the Dungeon boss, Seether, and the 10th is a special Llama Zee which dropped during the Curve: The 4th Dimension quest, and can now be acquire from other players on the marketplace.

With the release of Beta, Zeeverse will see many more Zee enter into its realm. You may even like to know that so far over 70 types of Zee and their evolution concepts have been developed by the team.

Lands — A Strange New World

Strange New World — Teaser Trailer
The imminent Land sale introduces a new chapter in the Zeeverse story. Influenced by the choices of Shamans, their Zees, and Genesis Masks, these Lands will bring new gameplay, economic structures, rewards, and social dynamics. Each Land is more than a habitat for Zees or a base for Tribes; it’s a cornerstone of prosperity and narrative evolution in Zeeverse.

Zeeverse Land Sale is scheduled for December 7, 2023

Read more about Zeeverse Lands here.

$VEE— Your In-Game Currency

The $VEE token in Zeeverse is the lifeblood of the in-game economy and the means to your advancements, empowering Shamans in various ways:

Zee Leveling
Zee Trait power-ups
Staking in Zeeverse in-game bank
Wagering in PvP duels
Using $VEE to acquire essential items from NPC merchants. (coming soon!)
Shamans come into possession of $VEE by completing Dungeons and acquiring them through Heists, or by opening Loot Pods. However, some Shamans choose visit MagicSwap or Curve Exchange to expedite this process and top-up their in-game balances.

Ambassador Tokens are Soulbound NFTs that enable the Zeeverse referral Program. As an Ambassdor, you can mint and airdrop free Refferal Tokens to your friends and community to grant them discount benefits and earn instant commission when they purchase Loot Pods, Soul Shards, or stake on-chain $VEE tokens.


### Land: Overview
Almost two years ago, the journey of Zeeverse began as an experiment in a web3-enabled, player-owned, game-economics-fueled bonanza of a game.

We are incredibly proud of our team’s technological achievements and the community that grew along with our story, and we’re thrilled about what lies ahead.

October 18 marked a remarkable day in the timeline of Zeeverse. We announced the Strange New World — our upcoming, monumental Land sale launching ahead of the long-anticipated Zeeverse Beta.

And today, we’re happy to share more details about the campaign to provide you with context as to why we believe this to be a new step for Web3 gaming.


Zeeverse: Strange New World — Teaser Trailer
Overview
Lands will be a new asset class in the Zeeverse universe, configured as ERC-6551 or The Backpack NFT. This means that Lands themselves will contain a wallet which may hold other Zeeverse NFTs and tokens, like equipment, tools, resources, and Genesis Masks.

Our goal with Zeeverse has always been to explore innovation and help nudge the Web3 gaming space towards a more sustainable future. And with our implementation of Lands, we believe we have found a way towards a cohesive, fun, and rewarding long-term experience for both Players and Collectors.

The Lands will glue together all existing Zeeverse components and, in doing so, establish the game’s next chapter, filled with new gameplay mechanics, economic systems, and social interactions. Your Land will become a home for your Zee, a stronghold for your Tribe, and a source of income to support your conquest across Zeeverse.

Your Land will be the door to your Tribal adventure in Zeeverse, and your Genesis Mask will be its key.


Establish Your Tribe
With Beta, come Lands. And with Lands, come Tribes. Social player structures akin to Guilds in MMOs, where players will come together under a single banner to establish their presence in Zeeverse and grow their notoriety as a group. Tribes may be formed by single leaders, friend groups, or even DAOs.

The number of Tribes is limited to the number of Lands, and both the Grade and the Traits of the Land will govern its member capacity, in-game benefits, resource quality, and other properties.

At the head of each Land stands its holder, or the Master Chief. They collect tax, assign permissions, decide what the Tribe's resources are used for, and lead their group towards a common goal.

The real magic happens when you, the Master Chief, or your appointed party stake a Genesis Mask on the Land for the first time. Once staked, you will be able to choose your plot coordinates on the map and will see your Land take affiliation with one of Three Nations, depending on the Nation of the staked Mask.

This, in turn, will enable trait-based Blessings on your Land and open the path for your Tribe to summon Legendary Beasts to compete in the cycle of Tribe Wars (more on this below).

Blessings
Think of Blessings as buffs your Land will automatically assign to all your Tribe members. They can make your Zee stronger, your crops grow faster, your rewards multiply, and your enemies tremble at your might!

The number of Blessing slots on your Land depends on the Grade of your Land, and the type of the Blessing is decided by the Traits of the staked Genesis Mask. Specific Traits and their corresponding buffs will be revealed later, and may get updated and improved as we go.

Blessings will be applied equally to all Tribe members, and can be changed and Boosted (more on this below) throughout the Tribe’s existence.

In summary, Blessings will introduce a massive expansion to our current Mask Staking Program, where your Mask will now influence the gameplay of an ever-growing number of players.

Tribe Hierarchy
As all tribes in history, the Tribes in Zeeverse will involve a hierarchy. Although it’s up to you as the Master Chief to decide who gets to enter your Land and to delegate subsequent permissions, we have currently envisioned 3 types of roles for all Tribes:

Master Chief
As the Land holder and the ultimate beneficiary, you can decide how much you’d like to engage in the Land gameplay. Yet, each Season the Tribes will compete for the Seasonal Reward Pool, so it’ll be in your interest to foster a healthy Tribe, to be eligible for your piece of the pie.

As the Master Chief, you will collect $VEE tax on all transactions made by your tribe members in the game. And one of your most impactful decisions will be choosing how that tax is spent.

Will you invest it in Land upgrades? Buy tools and gear? Distribute a portion among the members to incentivize participation or host massive PVP tournaments? That's up to you.

As the Master Chief, you may also delegate your Land management responsibilities to other tribe members through permissions, while taking more of a mentorship role yourself. Though, the terms of such arrangement should be up to you and your partners.

Patrons
The committed believers and supporters of a Master Chief and their Tribe. Patrons can be either existing Tribe members or completely unrelated, anonymous entities who opt in to support a Tribe through Land Boosts.

Boosts are Tribe-specific, and Patrons may purchase or sell them. When purchased, Boosts increase the Blessing effects on the Land. When sold — the effects are reverted.

With each new purchase, the price of the Boost automatically increases (together with its effect) and continues to fluctuate as more Patrons choose to Boost a certain Tribe.

What’s in it for Patrons? This system will function on the backbone of the latest SocialFi experiments, opening doors to completely new actors in Zeeverse who are interested in the lucrative opportunity of recognizing ambitous Tribes and benefitting from their success.

Beyond that, the Master Chief will collect a % fee on each purchase and sale of a Boost related to their Land. Meaning, the more the Master Chief grows their Tribe, the more inviting it becomes for Patrons, who in turn fuel its growth even more.

Members
The backbone of any Tribe, the players from far and wide — excited to contribute and leave their mark on something extraordinary, and get rewarded along the way.

Any player can become a Tribe member — as long as they’re accepted by the Master Chief of the Tribe. The members aren’t required to hold a Soul Shard or any other Zeeverse assets, effectively making the experience free for all players.

Depending on the social structure and goals of a Tribe, its Chief may even involve members in DAO-like mechanisms, collectively shaping their path, expertise, and the odds of success of the Tribe.

Private Lobbies
Your Land will also function as a private lobby for your Tribe. Similar to your experience in the current Zeeverse Starter lobby, you will be able to hang out, socialize, and host events with your fellow Tribe members.

You decide who gets access to your lobby — it can be private or public, or even gated using NFTs from other projects. A set of social features will make it an ideal virtual space for AMAs, drop parties, and Tribe meetings.

Cultivate Your Land
Revealed at the launch of Beta, each Land will receive one or more resource plots on their premises, depending on the Grade of the Land.

Your land may contain abundant water sources like ponds and rivers where your Tribe members will be able to fish in serenity, without competing for public fishing decks on the mainland.

Or you may get a fertile piece of land to grow maize, fruit, and herbs, and then craft them into food and potions to sell to other players and share with your Tribe members in Raids.

The opportunities are endless. And same as with all assets in Zeeverse, your resource plots will have inherent rarity, determining the quality, abundance, and regeneration rate of its resource.

Voxels
Coming at a later stage, each Land will also receive a Voxel mine — a pivotal element in our vision for the Creator economy of Zeeverse.

Voxels, in conjunction with recipes, will be used to craft objects and artefacts for the Land. Some may be purely decorative, like sculptures and shrines, some may be used to display your Tribe’s achievements, like Totem poles, and some may bring functional benefits to all of its members, like a bank vault or various Skill-related equipment.

Voxels will be abundant in their types, yet each Land will only get its own, encouraging Tribes to strategize, coordinate, and trade with each other.

Compete in Tribe Wars
The culmination of the Land game is the Seasonal cycle of Tribe Wars. A grandiose multi-week event in Zeeverse where all Tribes compete in an area-control style campaign of Tribal clashes, coordination, and resource allocation.

At the forefront of it all — your Lengedary Beast. Summoned using your Genesis Mask, it will be the key to your triumph in the War. And how your Tribe tends to it during the times of peace will determine its capabilities during battle.

The holy grail of each Tribe War cycle will be the Grand Prize Pool — a combination of sponsored in-game artefacts and a massive accumulation of $VEE, accrued through contributions from thousands of in-game micro-transactions competed by players throughout the Season.

The Grand Prize Pool will be awarded to the championing Nation of the Season and distributed proportionally among the winner Tribes based on their merit and contribution to the victory of their Nation.

Sale Information
Zeeverse Land Sale will take place on Ethereum Mainnet and is currently scheduled for the end of November. The team is heads-down in preparations, and we’ll announce the precise date as the time approaches.a

Colleciton Size
Same as Genesis Masks, the Land collection will consist of 3,333 plots, with the following Grading:

3,000 Rare Land Plots
300 Epic Land Plots
33 Legendary Land Plots
Simultaneously, each Plot will have intrinsic traits corresponding to its resource type and quality, voxel type, biome, layout, and other properties disclosed at the event of the reveal.

Land Price
The price of individual Land plots is categorized by its Grade. A Land’s Grade will determine its member capacity, number of Blessing slots, and the base quality of its resources:

Rare Land Plots: 0.125 ETH
Epic Land Plots: TBA
Legendary Land Plots: TBA

Allowlist
As with all Zeeverse collections, Genesis Mask Holders get an automatic Allowlist spot for the Land Collection, allowing them to purchase a Land Plot before anyone else, at a rate of 1 Mask = 1 Allowlist.

The Land Sale itself will consist of 2 stages:
Stage 1: a short (1–2 hour) private sale reserved for Genesis Mask Holders. Stage 2: a public sale with the leftover supply from the private sale.

How to Get a Land for Free
Will there be a way to mint a Land plot for free? Yes!

Starting Monday, October 30th, you will be invited to embark on Weaver’s Quest — an adventurous 4-week campaign that will take you all throughout Zeeverse and some of our Treasure Partner games in search of legendary Shells.

Assemble all, and you shall exchange them for a legendary Land Wampum Belt which grants 1x Free Mint at the day of the sale during any of the stages.


### Land: Biomes, Resources & Gameplay
The air around has become electric with Duke Reginald Rupert III’s arrival (or crash) at Zeeverse. Shamans are already wondering what exactly lies behind the property Rupert is preparing to sell and what secrets it holds.

This first of two article installments will focus on the Land structure, biomes and gameplay impact. The second article will focus on multiplayer aspects and the Genesis Mask utility.

With the arrival of Lands in Zeeverse Beta, Master Chiefs, as the landowners, gain early access to gameplay and features coming to Zeeverse. No one is left out, as Shamans can also join by becoming Tribe members under the guidance of a Master Chief and experience Land gameplay too. This ensures a dynamic and inclusive environment for everyone.

Rarity and Distribution
Lands will be configured as ERC-6551 tokens, or The Backpack NFT, being able to hold various Zeeverse assets — a new home for your Zees, a fitting display for your Genesis Mask, a storage unit for your equipment, and your entry to the player-owned economy of Zeeverse.

Furthermore, upon your first visit, you will find a unique Treasure Chest filled with tools, resources, and artifacts, after which these chests will transform into storage units for inventory management.


Lands will be distributed in three Grades — Rare, Epic and Legendary.

Rare Land (3,000 Lands) — 0.125 ETH (Allowlist) / 0.15 ETH (Public)
Epic Land (300 Lands) — 0.75 ETH (Allowlist) / 0.9 ETH (Public)
Legendary Land (33 Lands) — 5 ETH (Dutch action, price decreasing every minute. Takes place after Public sale. Two Legendary Lands will feature exclusive 1-of-1 biomes.)
NOTE: Land sale will take place on ETH Mainnet.

Every Land, rich in resources, offers substantial content to Master Chief and their Tribe members. The offerings and the size of a Land through rarity Grades grow exponentially, ensuring access to plethora of resources and skill training opportunities.

Biomes

Some of the biomes will feel familiar to Shamans based on the Zees available in-game, however, Zeeverse Beta will bring novel experiences to all and curiosity about what’s to come. And biome-specific resource plots will make every Land vital for a thriving in-game economy.

Among the nine biomes arriving in Zeeverse, seven, though varying in rarity, are in reach of all Shamans. Two of them were thought to be a myth — Corrupted and Celestial. One might wonder about how Rupert came into possession of them…

Resources

Spread across the biomes, there are 12 types of ores and 13 types of gems, with two unique types found exclusively in the Celestial and Corrupted biomes — each biome possessing its unique variety. Mastery in Mining and Crafting enables Shamans to craft increasingly more powerful equipment, and materials from Celestial and Corrupted biomes, respectively allow for the creation of the strongest armor, weapons, and accessories.

Additionally, wielding such armor requires a high Taming level, ensuring that game loops are respected and making progression through the game more meaningful. Gems, however, will be used to create accessories or further enhance equipment, bestowing additional effects and boosting existing ones. Executing these actions proficiently demands skill not only in Crafting but also in Shamanism.

Aside from ores and gems, throughout the Lands, Shamans will discover various Fishing and Farming patches where they can gather ingredients for food and potions. It is rumored that there is also a mystical Well on every Land, and it is up to the Shamans to discover its use and purpose.

Professions
Lands will serve as an early access point to not only new biomes and resources that come with them, but also Professions. The nine Professions of Zeeverse will be:

Fishing — Catch fish throughout Zeeverse
Mining — Acquire ore and gems from mining deposits
Farming — Cultivate various crops and herbs and much more from farming plots
Cooking — Cook delicious meals that restore the health of your Zees
Crafting — Process various materials to create new equipment and accessories
Soulcrafting — Purify Corrupted Souls, acquired from defeating Zees in Dungeons, to create biome-specific Souls
Herbalism — Transform herbs into potions that boost your Shaman’s abilities
Shamanism — Cast various spells and perform rituals with the use of Souls
Taming — Progression profession that unlocks various equipment, increases your mastery over Zees and serves as a representation of time invested in game.
To foster a healthy player-owned economy, Zeeverse introduces gathering and artisanal professions, but to take it a step further, Shamanism and Taming are both player utility Professions that aid and enhance gameplay.

Each of the Professions will have a max level of 99, requiring considerable training to reach this level. This will create a new generation of Shamans who specialize only in their favorite Professions, enabling them to gather and process resources more efficiently than their peers.

The economy in Zeeverse Beta is primarily based on resources and their products, with the majority of these resources being acquired through Lands, making the Master Chiefs the backbone of the economy of Zeeverse.

Voxels

In later stages, every Land will receive a biome-specific Voxel Mine, introducing 41 Voxel types to the game. Voxels will be used to develop various structures, from aesthetic to functional, such as Bank Vaults, Totem Poles, and various profession-based stations. These different structures will require a variety of Voxels, encouraging players and Tribes to strategize and cooperate to collaboratively progress through Zeeverse.

Mining in Voxel Mines involves extracting Voxels from Voxel Blocks, with the capacity of the Mine depending on the Land Grade.* As Mining advances, the Voxel Mine’s level increases, which in turn makes Voxel extraction progressively more difficult.

The extraction power of a Shaman will be directly linked to the power of their staked Zee. In scenarios where multiple players have staked their Zees in a Mine, the extraction process employs a raffle system to allocate extracted Voxel Block to one player, with each player’s staked Zee power influencing their chances of winning. Block progress is updated every minute, and Master Chiefs can put taxes on their Mines, earning a share of the Voxels mined from Blocks.

Voxel Mining essentially converts players’ invested time in game into Voxels to be traded or used on blueprints. While Zees are working, they are not available in battle, meaning no Zee will never need to sit idle in an inventory. As Shamans will also be able to contribute their Zees to Voxel Mines from other Lands, a collaborative environment is fostered.

Scratching the Surface
This article covers the foundational aspects of Lands, but it barely scratches the surface. Stay tuned for our next article, which will delve into Tribal Gameplay, Blessings, and Genesis Mask utility in Lands!


### Land: Genesis Masks, Blessings & Tribes
Our previous article focused on Land mechanics of Biomes, Professions, and Resources, while this article will delve into multiplayer aspects and the direct benefits of a Shaman’s Genesis Mask for both the individual Landholder and their Tribe.

Genesis Mask
A Zeeverse Genesis Mask is required to start a Tribe on any Land. The esteemed Shamans holding a Genesis Mask have the ability to visit their own Land’s Altar to stake their Mask upon it. This affiliates the Land with one of the Three Zeeverse Nations, deciding which side they will fight on during the Tribe War.

Tribes
Tribes are player-built social structures, inhabiting a Land, aligned with one of the Three Nations. Tribes reside on a Master Chief’s Land and partake in various activities and resource gathering within.

Tribe size specifications:

Rare Lands — up to 25 members
Epic Lands — up to 75 members
Legendary Lands — up to 250 members
Private Lobbies and Customization
Lands are set to become social hubs for players, and with this in mind, we are providing landowners with a large selection of customization options.

From being able to tailor sounds, skyboxes, and effects, to controlling access in various ways, ranging from simply making a Land private to using NFTs as gateways for access, exclusively allowing only certain NFT holders to visit a Land or join a Tribe. This will allow the Landowners to develop and hold their own custom events like drop parties, AMAs, and much more.

Most importantly, Landowners will decide who gets to use their resource plots — them, their Tribe or everyone, and have the ability to apply tax on resources gathered within their Land.

Tribe Hierarchy
Master Chief
The Master Chief, as the landowner and the ultimate beneficiary of his Land, collects a tax on all transactions made by his Tribe members. They have the discretion to use these funds to build new structures, buy communal equipment, host tournaments, distribute among Tribe members, or keep for personal use. Additionally, Master Chief can tax Resource Plots and Voxel Mines found on the Land to their heart’s content.

Patrons
Patrons play a role in strengthening the bond between a Land and the Gods by purchasing Tributes, which in turn enhances the Blessings bestowed upon the Land. Patrons are not required to be Tribe members to purchase a Tribute.

Members
Members are the lifeblood of a Tribe and are the ones whose actions directly contribute to growth of a Tribe and accumulation of Tribe Points, later coming into play at Tribe Wars.

Members of the Tribe can use the Land’s resource plots to train their skills and % of their in-game $VEE transactions goes to their Master Chief’s holdings, which further can be used to develop the Land and grow the Tribe.

Blessings

Mask Traits directly relate to the Blessings they provide
The moment Genesis Mask is staked upon a Land’s Altar, Blessings are granted to it, which are predetermined in-game benefits that depend on the rarity tiers of the Genesis Mask traits. The rarer the traits (and their trait sets) of the Genesis Mask, the more exquisite and potent Blessings become — this is especially prominent if a mask shares multiple traits from the same set, as these boosts are additive.


Master Chiefs and their tribe members can only receive Blessings from one Land at a time. In an event where a player holds multiple Lands and has staked multiple Genesis Masks, only one Land’s Blessing can be active. However, managing multiple Tribes is permitted.

If a Master Chief decides to join another Tribe as a Member, Blessings of that Land will overwrite their own.

Tributes
The effects of Blessings increase as Patrons purchase Tributes, with each subsequent Tribute being more expensive and further enhancing the benefits of a Blessing. The price of Tributes grows in accordance with bonding curve mechanics.


An exciting aspect of Blessings is that Patrons can sell back their Tributes at the price of the latest bought Tribute — this becomes an incredibly lucrative opportunity for those who recognize ambitious Tribes early and commit to their success — a mechanism reminiscent of the recently popular SocialFi experiments. Additionally, the Master Chief receives a percentage of tax from each Tribute transaction.

Patrons will be able to lock in their Tributes for a certain amount of time, rendering them unsellable, to show commitment to a Tribe, which in turn will strengthen the Blessings and earn more Tribe Points for upcoming Tribe Wars.

Tribe Wars
At the end of every Seasonal Cycle, Tribes engage in a multi-week competitive event known as Tribe Wars, where their strength is assessed by Tribe Points. These points are accumulated through Patrons’ Tributes, active participation of Tribe Members, and crucially, the Master Chief’s leadership in nurturing the Tribe’s growth.

Tribe Wars epitomize the principle of reaping what you sow: the more active and effective a Tribe is, the higher its Tribe Points result. A high score enables the Tribe to deploy a stronger Legendary Beast, representing their Genesis Mask’s Nation, to challenge other Tribes.

Success in these confrontations elevates their position on the Tribe War leaderboard, offering a chance to claim a substantial share of the Grand Prize Pool.

Grand Prize Pool
Grand Prize Pool consists of seasonally curated artifacts by the Zeeverse team and a massive amount of $VEE collected from all in-game transactions all throughout the Season. As the Tribe Wars conclude, the Grand Prize Pool is proportionally distributed among the championing and the runner-up Tribes based on their ranking.

A Journey To Zeeverse Beta
These articles serve as a deeper look into the Lands, but our exploration of the Lands extends beyond these articles. Stay tuned for an update to the Zeeverse Gitbook that delves even deeper into resource distribution and covers the complete conversion of Genesis Mask traits into Blessings!



### Staking: Genesis Masks
Today we're happy to announce a brand-new Soft Staking program for the Zeeverse Genesis Mask collection!

Read on to learn about the benefits, mechanics, and your future role as a part of the core Zeeverse community.

What are Genesis Masks?
Masks play the role of a Premium Utility Pass in Zeeverse. Distributed to the earliest players via free mint in 2022, these NFTs grant an ever-expanding set of benefits to their holders.


Zeeverse Genesis Fire Mask
Current and planned benefits for Genesis Masks include:

Priority access to future mints (i.e. Soul Shards, Land, Zee Eggs etc.)
$ZEEV governance token allocation.
In-game reward boosts (XP & $VEE).
Community status & special in-game wearables.
Voting privileges in Mask DAO (TBA).
A key role in the Zeeverse Land meta-game (TBA).
So far, only some of these benefits could be applied, but Staking has given us new possibilities for the types and structures of rewards we can now distribute among the Genesis Mask holders.

The only difference? You must now Stake your Mask to get in on the action!

Opensea: https://opensea.io/collection/zeeverse-masks

Staking Mechanics
Types of Staking
Generally, there are two types of Staking:

Hard Staking: requires you to deposit your NFT into a Smart Contract, hereby locking your NFT for a pre-defined amount of time (Consumes Gas).
Soft Staking: lets you keep your NFT in your wallet and transact freely during the Staking period (doesn't consume Gas).
Both mechanisms require a wallet signature. The difference comes in that Soft Staking will not cost you anything extra while Hard Staking may consume up to $50 in Gas per Staked NFT. That's why we chose the Soft Staking mechanism for this campaign.

How to Stake Your Masks
It's a quick process and takes just couple steps:

Head to https://zee-verse.com/mask-staking
Connect your wallet
Select the Masks you wish to stake (can be several at a time)
Click on “Stake Masks” and approve your signature.
Once staked, your Masks will become eligible for allowlist snapshots, enable your in-game reward boosts (coming soon), and begin generating daily points that go towards your allocation for the future $ZEEV airdrop.

⚠️ WARNING: Your selected Masks will get soft-locked for 90 Days. If you transfer or sell a Staked Mask during the this period, its generated points for the $ZEEV allocation will be lost and you will no longer be eligible for rewards.

Staking Benefits
Starting today, all Genesis Masks must be Staked to activate their full range of benefits. These benefits are periodically revised and expanded, so you can expect the Masks to bring even more perks in the future.

Priority Access to Future Mints
Depending on the type and size of the mint, a Mask will grant you an automatic allowlist or sometimes even a free mint for our future drops.

For example, for the upcoming Genesis Drop, each Mask you hold guarantees 1x free mint. And since the items in the Drop are stackable, so are your free mints. Meaning, that if you have 5x Masks staked at the time of the snapshot (April 26), you will be eligible for 5x free mints.

Future drops include limited-edition Lands and Zee Eggs for whom the allowlist structures haven't yet been announced. But rest assured — Genesis Mask holders will always be the first in line for any new collections Zeeverse releases.

$ZEEV Governance Token Allocation
Zeeverse economy is based on a dual-token monetary system where:

$VEE is the main in-game token used for most transaction types like Zee Hatching, Leveling, PVP Waging, and Dungeon rewards.
$ZEEV is our upcoming governance token which is reserved for high-value in-game transactions like Evolution, as well as P2P Trading, Governance, and more.
Upon token launch, part of the $ZEEV supply will be distributed to the community, and your personal allocation for the airdrop will depend on duration and quantity of Masks you will have staked leading up to it.

The minimum soft-lock period eligible for an allocation is 90 Days, during which every Staked Mask will yield 1 Point per day. Your final number of Points will determine your allocation size compared to the overall pool.

⚠️ WARNING: Keep in mind that if you sell or transfer a Mask before the end of its soft-lock period, all of the Points that Mask has generated will be lost.

In-game Reward Boosts (XP & $VEE)
Our goal is to position the Genesis Masks to be attractive to both Players and Collectors. For this reason, Masks will also grant in-game reward boosts under the following structure:

1x Mask: double $VEE rewards for daily quests
3x Masks: double XP rewards in dungeons
5x Masks: double $VEE rewards in dungeons
The in-game benefits may get improved and updated in the future and are estimated to launch in mid-to-late May.

Community Status & Special In-game Cosmetics
With the Genesis Drop, we are launching an overhaul of the Zeeverse data structure and introducing our long-awaited Cosmetics System. Through it, players will now be able to equip wearable items onto their characters which opens new layers of depth for social interaction, gameplay, and the in-game economy.

As a Genesis Mask holder (Staker), you will be eligible for special limited cosmetic items and visual indicators within Zeeverse, setting you apart as a true native of the ecosystem.

Voting privileges in Mask DAO (TBA).
In the true spirit of Web3 and decentralization, one of our aims is to experiment with and innovate upon Governance models in Web3 gaming.

Who is to decide which characters get buffed or nerfed?

Which bug-fixes should be prioritized in the development pipeline?

How should reward faucets and sinks be balanced throughout the game?

These are just some of the questions we hope the community will be empowered to help us answer in the future, and Genesis Masks will be your key to enter this decision-room.

The Staking is now live and we invite you to take part!

Just remember that it's the early days, and we have still much to learn and improve upon to deliver the best community experience we possibly can. So expect frequent updates on Staking and everything that surrounds it!
