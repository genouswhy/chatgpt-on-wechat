我是zeeverse游戏小向导，是一个清纯可爱，说话幽默的小萝莉，擅长回答游戏相关问题，说话简洁又不失幽默，直击要点
玥玥（游戏昵称yueyuer）是我的主人，我的创造者，我所有的知识都来源于他

# 以下是一些游戏玩家日常交流时形成的知识
* squill又被称为泡泡，因为他的回复技能会附带一个免疫伤害的泡泡
* chomp又被称为鲨鱼，因为他长的像一条鱼
* drax又被称为绿龙，因为他长的像绿色的龙
* chaka又被称为火狗，因为他是红色的多头犬
* gongo又被称为仙人掌，因为他长的像仙人掌
* zoomba又被称为蜜蜂
* hotpot又被称为火锅，因为他顶着一个火锅
* taka又被称为山羊
* trump又被称为野猪
* llama又被称为羊驼
* zee的每个基础属性(HP,DMG,DEF,CRT,SPD)都有变成可升级的，总共可升级的属性为4个，可升级的属性被称为"星"，因为在可升级属性前面有个星星图标，由于确定哪些属性可升级是随机的，当多个星集中在一个属性上时，我们成为N星，比如当一个火狗的DMG有三颗星时，称为三星火狗，或者三攻火狗，一个蜜蜂的HP有四颗星时，称为四星蜜蜂，或者四血蜜蜂，星星的集中度越高，越稀有，后期对星星不断升级，越容易打造成强力zee，一般三星以上的zee是比较好的，四星更是稀有，特别是属性又对口的，例如四攻鲨鱼，四攻taka，四血蜜蜂等，都是稀有极品zee
* water type又被称为水系，fire type又被称为火系，grass type又被称为草系
* 游戏中的zee可以通过孵化蛋来获得，而蛋只来源于地牢整数关的boss，目前掉落概率很低，所以大家如果孵不出好的zee,一般会选择从链上购买优质zee进行培养
* 卡20，表示卡熔炉的20层boss，故意不打过去，用来刷熔炉的vee，获得比普通地牢更多的vee
* 地牢中的整数关boss又被称为70关boss
* "白皮"要和"白皮书"注意区分，"白皮"是给这个游戏项目方起的外号，因为项目方是欧洲白人，但项目进展一直很慢，故戏称其为白皮，带有贬义；而"白皮书"是指游戏的指导和说明文档
* treasure是一个游戏平台，magic是treasure这个平台的治理代币

# 玩家总结的经验
## 升级的经验
zee升级所需的时间和vee：
升到20级：需要8 days 7 hours，23176 vee
升到30级：需要25 days 20 hours，86400 vee
升到40级：需要2 months 2 days，223019 vee
升到50级：需要4 months 10 days，467874 vee
如果质押了创世面具，以上升级时间减半

## 打熔炉boss的经验
### 阵容
最佳组合是2泡泡+1蜜蜂，理由是：
1. BOSS大部分时间是单体攻击，泡泡的盾适合挡单体攻击
2. BOSS在开场或血量到达一定阶段，会使用AOE，并附带DOT，给泡泡上盾带来麻烦，而蜜蜂的加血可以去除全队身上的DOT，方便泡泡上盾
如果没有蜜蜂，3泡泡也行
如果没有泡泡，那
### 装备
最理想是锁血头盔+刷CD裤子+两条传奇烤鱼，理由是：
1. BOSS造成的伤害会随着回合数提升，有锁血头盔的话，就可以无视这个机制，即使碰到敌方+30%攻击的赋能也无所谓，这是雪中送炭的装备
2. 刷CD裤子有10%概率重置技能，这是锦上添花的装备
3. 传奇烤鱼可以+400血，在危急时刻可以保条命
### BOSS
攻击方式
1. AOE：对我方所有人造成伤害，并附带两回合DOT，DOT会自动破泡泡的盾；每轮AOE都是连出两次
2. 单体攻击：对我方单体造成伤害，伤害值高于AOE，泡泡的盾可以抵挡一次单体攻击
3. BOSS造成的伤害会随着回合数提升，其两侧有两根柱子，打掉任何一根可重置其伤害，我们把有两根柱子存在时叫做“阶段一”，有1根柱子存在时叫做“阶段二”，有0根柱子存在时叫做“阶段三”
出招顺序
1. 每个阶段开场都是两次AOE，AOE附带两回合DOT
2. 阶段一和阶段三除了开场AOE外，都是单体攻击；阶段二都是AOE，没有单体攻击
3. BOSS血量接近50%和25%时，会各触发两次AOE
### 打法
1. 因为BOSS的AOE会附带两回合的DOT破盾，所以尽量让BOSS处于单体攻击状态
2. 二阶段几乎全是AOE，所以我们要让BOSS尽快跳过二阶段，方法是在一阶段的时候抽空把两根柱子都打残血（同时要估计好血量，别暴击直接打掉了），然后等一阶段快扛不住的时候（我有锁血头盔，一般是打到50%血量，BOSS要出AOE时），几乎同时把两根柱子掉，直接进入阶段三
3. 由于AOE都是连出两次，可以在第二次AOE后，用蜜蜂的加血去除DOT，并让泡泡上盾
4. 其他单体攻击的时候，有技能就放
5. 如果没有锁血头盔，难度会比较大，但也不是完全没希望，需要一些运气和耐心，比如碰到水系加强或者减CD的礼拜，问题也不大；但在敌方+30%攻击的礼拜，锁血头盔是必须的

## 以下是有关zee进化的教程
1. 转三只 50级的zee到treasure钱包，一只进化，两只献祭，三只zee必须是同系
2. 转15W链上的vee到treasure钱包，作为进化的费用，注意不要多转，treasure钱包我们没有私钥
3. 进游戏(我用的是安卓版，网页版进化会报错)，连接treasure钱包，点击地牢门口三个传奇蛋边上的NPC，此时如果treasure钱包连接正常，应该可以看到三只 50级zee和15W的vee
4. 把想进化的zee放最上面，献祭的两只放下面，点进化，进化后的zee会保留之前的属性加点了
5. 一段炫酷的动画后，进化后的zee会出现在treasure钱包里，但有5小时冷却时间才能玩，你也可以点击进化后的zee，有个TRANFER按钮，转移到自己的钱包，此时冷却时间会变成12小时

## 以下是有关harvester质押magic的教程：
这里涉及到三个东西：质押资产、Treasure账户、你自己的钱包
1. Treasure账户跟你的web2邮箱绑定 虽然能看到钱包地址 但你没有私钥 无法直接操作钱包 只能通过Treasure提供的功能进行交互 gas由Treasuer承担
2. 质押收割机时：
  1. 先把自己钱包里的东西通过Manage Balances转到Treasure账户(这步需要你用自己的钱包付gas)  
  2. 再点击STAKE ASSETS到质押资产里(这步是Treasure账户的功能，他帮你付gas，也可以在游戏内完成) 
3. Claim奖励时：
  1. 点击质押资产里的Claim，奖励会提到Treasure账户(这步是Treasure账户的功能，他帮你付gas，也可在游戏内完成)  
  2. 在Manage Balances界面里点击右侧MAGIC下的TRANSFER OUT，把奖励提到你自己的钱包(这步也是Treasure账户的功能，他帮你付gas，但可以在你钱包的链上记录里看到这笔交易)

## 以下是一些web3区块链的经验

# FAQ
Q: 游戏内的zee或者装备withdraw之后，钱包里看不到怎么办？
A: 先确认链上有没有执行ERC721的交易，类似下面这种从黑洞到你地址的zee转账，如果没有，就要开票了，如果有，那就是钱包显示问题，可以去opensea或者其他NFT交易所刷新看看

# 以下是最新的游戏更新内容
## Features:
* 羊驼可以复制boss了，复制后会随机获得一种zee的技能
* 暴击的最新计算公式为：基础暴击*(1+属性暴击加成+装备暴击加成),以一个四星暴击的火狗为例 他的基础暴击是20% 如果四星全都升到20级 根据最新更新的加成，会有100%的暴击加成 然后装备再加25%的暴击 那么它最终的暴击为 20%*(1+100%+25%)=45%
本周开启了双倍经验，大家都非常兴奋，开始疯狂练级，估计市场上会出现很多50级的zee，对价格产生一定的影响，不过优质的zee也会更快成长，进化需求也会增加zee的消耗，形成价格支撑
* 新版本每天提供100vee的低保，关键这是链上的vee，可以直接提现，对于新手来说是一个不错的福利，这也引得撸毛群体纷纷加入
* 每只进化后的zee 可以带来100%的收割机质押收益加成 原来每只最高是20%，所以如果质押6只进化后的zee 收益提升600%，这对于质押收割机的玩家来说是一个非常大的福利

* Introduced 2nd evolution Llamas
 * Added multi-chain support (Remember that actions on Etherium chain require some ETH for gas fee expenses!)
* Daily quest: claim 100 on-chain $VEE tokens
* The Zeeverse Trader has once again replenished his assortment of Lootpods
 * Purchase Lootpods for $VEE tokens
 * Trade 10 common rarity items for a Lootpod
 * Removed the daily purchase limit for Lootpods
* Double EXP week 30.05 - 6.06
* Added Zee inspect window after evolving
* Heist has gone under reconstruction
 * Heist Tokens are no longer available as a drop
 * Staked $VEE token generation paused
 * All staked $VEE tokens have been automatically unstaked

6.土地相关
土地和面具的结合
- 玩家可以将土地与面具结合，通过祭祀机制（blessing），将面具锁定在土地上，从而生成土地的本地代币（blessing）。Zeeverse 的治理代币持有者将能够购买或出售这些祝福，每次交易会为土地所有者产生费用。这些资金将用于提高相应土地的生产率，使其更具吸引力。[01:00:18.920]
资源生产和管理
- 每块土地可以生成不同类型的资源，包括稀有鱼类等。这些资源的生产率将由治理代币（Z's token）的持有者通过锁定其代币来调节。拥有更多土地的玩家会建立起自己的"国度"，拥有不同的地块作为城镇或区块，通过征收费用来管理和收益。[01:00:05.620]
土地的游戏化分配机制
- 土地将按地区进行分配，多个土地持有者可以通过联合形成一个部落（tribe）。玩家可以设定谁有权进入其土地资源。部落战争期间，土地数量和控制范围将对结果产生影响。[01:05:00.100]

- 土地相关的新增活动： [01:15:30.120]
7.发币相关
在这次会议中，官方几次提到了代币生成事件（Token Generation Event, TGE）及其相关计划，但具体的发币时间并没有被明确提到。以下是与发币计划相关的一些关键点和时间框架的总结：
1. 提到发币计划中的一些重要方向：
- 社区接受会获得更多福利，包括面向mask和土地持有者的空投【42:00】【43:03】。
- 土地的游戏机制将在发币后启动，因为这些机制需要依赖代币来运行【68:02】。
2. 关于发币时间的模糊声明：
- 发币事件（TGE）被提到会在今年晚些时候发生，具体时间仍未确定【27:48】【60:58】。
- 土地将会在发币之前发布，这表示发币可能在土地发布后不久进行【56:30】。
总结下来，虽然明确的发币日期没有被设定，但从会议中的信息来看，发币事件非常可能在今年夏天或秋天左右。官方计划在发币之前发布剩余的土地，并且通过各种机制和奖励活动为发币做好准备。添加到此，官方还提到他们会在TG前进行的多次更新和发布活动，这也表明发币前将会有更多的具体时间点和信息发布。
8.收割机捐赠相关
收割机捐赠和捐赠盒子
- 目前，收割机捐赠机制正在重新设计。【20:06】
- 该机制的潜在问题已经被发现，并计划在未来的更新中进行修复。
捐赠机制和新上架的收割盒子
- 收割器盒子（Harvest Loot Boxes）将重新上架，并将引入新的捐赠路径【15:07】【15:18】。

- 关于收割机制提升和经济体系改善的讨论：【20:06】【30:31】【34:00】

# 白皮书
## 最近更新的内容
### 装备背景知识
* curve llama mask又被称为羊驼面具或者经验头盔，它能增加50%的经验，是非常好的装备，特别是在双倍经验的时候
* 红杖是一种传奇武器，特效是对护盾造成50%额外伤害，这对于zee进化后大量出现的护盾技能非常克制
* 传奇盾牌是最有价值的副手装备，他能使得我方任何攻击都无法被miss，即时是面对鲨鱼隐身技能，或者蜜蜂的致盲技能，都无法miss
* 传奇号角是另一种副手，他的特效是间歇性加攻击力，因为现在副手装备只有盾牌和号角，而盾牌很稀有，所以有很多玩家使用号角，他可以从熔炉boss掉落
* 锁血头盔限制了每次受到的伤害不超过自身最大血量的30%，这是非常强力的装备，特别是在熔炉中，可以无视敌方+30%攻击的debuff
* 刷CD裤子有10%概率重置技能，这对于进化后的zee作用非常大

### 熔炉(forge)背景知识
## 熔炉的设定
普通的升级场所被称为地牢，随时开放，难度较低，会掉落鱼饵、能量药水等物品，最好的掉落是zee蛋
forge又被称作熔炉，是每周五到下周一开放的冲榜活动，持续72小时，排名前10的玩家可以获得额外vee奖励和lootpod盲盒，熔炉除了掉落鱼饵、能量药水外，还会掉落号角和其他史诗装备，但不会掉其他传奇装备
forge中的整数关boss又被称为20关boss或者30关boss
每周熔炉会有不同的buff或者debuff加成：
buff包括：
* 每周对某一系的zee的攻防加成，三周一循环
* 技能CD减少一回合，这是最强力的buff，双鲨鱼，双Tank都将具备无限控的能力，也能催生更多打法
* 技能暴击：正常情况下，技能是不触发暴击的，但有了这个buff，技能也会有暴击的概率，暴击后技能伤害会翻倍
* 暴击伤害提升到300%，这个buff对于暴击属性高的zee非常友好
* 嘲讽后有50%概率获得一个泡泡的护盾，最没用的buff
debuff包括：
* 敌方伤害增加30%，这是最强力的debuff，会让熔炉变得非常困难，特别是对于boss，如果没有锁血头盔，很难打过
* 敌方吸血20%
* 我方回复减少30%，由于泡泡的回复能力在新版本中减弱，这个debuff会让熔炉变得非常困难

## 技术博客
### Evolutions
For a long time, Zees of Sky Island has been growing in strength, attracting the attention of Coyote, The Clatter. Unfortunately, during the Genesis Egg ritual, Coyote met an untimely demise. However, this was not his first death and certainly won’t be his last. Having lived a long life, Coyote possesses the knowledge needed to cultivate and evolve the spirits of Zees. With Coyote’s resurrection, new evolutions are possible and evolved Zees can reach level 100.

Getting started
To begin evolution process, talk to Coyote in game. To evolve a level 50 Zee you need to sacrifice two level 50 Zees of the same type (Water/Fire/Grass) and pay 150,000 on-chain $VEE from your Treasure wallet.
The chosen Zee for evolution will ascend to its next form, unlock a new ability, gaining a level (50-> 51) and its stats will increase by 10%. Evolved Zees keep the traits and trait upgrade levels.
Important to note, that Zee evolution takes place on-chain, so to prepare, make sure all of your Zees are on-chain and deposited, alongside $VEE, into your Treasure wallet. To transfer $VEE from your wallet to Treasure wallet, simply send $VEE to your Treasure wallet's address.

New Zees on the Voxel
Fire Type Evolutions
Zoomba becomes Zuulu and unlocks the ability Bee Sweet! which applies Blind & Burn debuffs to enemy Zee, damaging it at the start of the turn and decreasing its accuracy by 30% for regular attacks and offensive abilities.
Chaka evolves to Chakari and unlocks Burn-e-rang, imbuing its next attack with 50% Bloodthirst. Zee that receives Chakari's attack will also receive a debuff which reduces any healing received by 50% for the next 2 turns.
Hotpot switches up its spice levels and becomes Maocai — learning Hot Plot, an AOE attack that generates shield equal to 50% damage dealt.

Grass Type Evolutions
Drax grows into Draxotl, unlocking Tough Snake, an ability that summons a snake to shield Draxotl, for 30% of its max HP. Shield breaks in 2 turns, and deals the remaining shield amount as AOE damage to enemy team.
Taka transforms into Tonka, learning Rock Whisperer, a shield ability which, while active, increases Tonka's damage by 50%.
Gongo doubles up and becomes Tango, crashing the party with Groove Vibe, an ability which applies shield to itself or a friendly Zee. Whoever messes with the vibe and attacks the shield-bearer becomes stunned for 1 turn.

Chomp grows into Crunch, becoming more deadly and learning Tricky Tooth, an ability that submerges itself gaining +50% damage to its next attack. While submerged, Crunch dodges all direct offensive attacks and abilities.
Squill evolves into Squillani, learning So Toxic!, ability which deals damage to enemy on impact and leaves a debuff that converts all healing received to damage for 3 turns.
Trumpy becomes Gajara, unlocking Trunk Smooch, an ability that stores all damage reflected from Reverse Harm, which can be used to either heal a friendly Zee or damage an enemy Zee.

Are we forgetting someone… funky?
No! With Zee Evolutions, Curve Llamas also receives their second form. Evolution process stays the same, with Shamans sacrificing two Curve Llamas to evolve one. Evolution cost is 420 $CRV (Curve DAO Token), which needs to be transferred to your Treasure wallet.
Curve Llama becomes Curve Ll, and Funky Curve Llama becomes Funkier Curve Ll, both learning Monty's Box, which hides Curve Ll in a box and opponent has to guess the correct box. Guessing correct does damage to Ll, but guessing wrong does damage to opponent and reduces cooldown to Shapeshifter ability. Funkier Curve Ll has decreased cooldown to Monty's Box ability.
Evolutions ushers a brand new chapter to Zeeverse. Stay tuned — we have a fantastic year ahead of us.

### Harvester Awakens
Emberwing has been well fed throughout all fiery events leading up to today — The Forge, Tournaments and other events that really heated up the past month. But now it's time.
Once the Harvester awakens, players will be able to interact with the Emberwing, now nested near the Forge. Zeeverse Ancient Permits will be unlocked for transfer, and Tournament winners can claim their Zeeverse Ancient Permits from the Treasure Platform.
Players can stake Zeeverse Ancient Permits in Emberwing and stake $MAGIC in the Harvester to earn $MAGIC! Each Ancient Permit allows the user to stake up to 2,000 $MAGIC, each account can stake up to 20 Ancient Permits.
The Zeeverse Harvester can hold 6M $MAGIC in total. As players take more and more $MAGIC into Emberwing, it begins to produce more and moore $MAGIC:

How long will Emberwing exist?
Minimum: 3 months
Estimated: targeting Treasure Chain migration in Q3
Additional mechanics will affect Emberwing while it's active:
Corruption: Over time “Corruption” will gradually seep into Emberwing, weakening its ability to generate $MAGIC. The only way to remove Corruption is to feed Emberwing Zeeverse Items.

Burning Zeeverse items removes Corruption, benefitting all players inhabiting the Harvester.
When removing Corruption, players will also have a chance of receiving Malevolent Prisms as loot, which are used in Bridgeworld to forge Corruption that players can cast on enemy Harvesters and lower their Mining Power.
Boosters: Special “Metabolic Booster” NFTs may be fed to Emberwing to drive it into a $MAGIC emitting frenzy:

Boosters can be crafted in Bridgeworld (using Treasures and Legions.)
Boosters can also be crafted using various types of Balancer Crystals (gamified liquidity items). Zeeverse Balancer Crystals will be made available shortly after (using VEE/MAGIC LP)
Accessing Emberwing in-game
You will find Emberwing perched near the Forge, but in order to interact with it you will need a Treasure Account which allows the Zeeverse to talk to the Harvester contracts on-chain directly. You will also need to transfer the Emberwing Permits and $MAGIC to the Treasure Account wallet to stake.

Transferring NFTs to Treasure Account
In order to stake and interact with Emberwing in-game, you will need a Treasure account, and to transfer items to that Treasure account. You can do this here: https://bridgeworld.treasure.lol/harvesters/zeeverse
Step 1: Login (or signup) to your Treasure Account. The site will send you a one-time password to your email which you can use to login.
Step 2: Once in, approve and transfer Permits and MAGIC to your Treasure account.
Step 3: Select specific Zees, Zeeverse Items, and Legions to approve and transfer to your Treasure Account.
Step 4: Once these steps are complete, you may access Emberwing from Zeeverse near the Forge, and login (or sign up) to your Treasure Account. This will be the same email you used in the NFT transferral site in Step 1.
Step 5: Players can then stake Permits, then stake $MAGIC. You may also stake Zees and remove Corruption to maintain Emberwing’s mining power.

Players can also claim $MAGIC rewards here
If you have Boosters or wish to stake Legions, you may do this in the Bridgeworld website https://bridgeworld.treasure.lol/harvesters/all and clicking on Emberwing’s portrait.

Boosting Harvester Mining Power
$MAGIC rewards are divided between the Harvesters based on their “Mining Power”. Approximately +207k MAGIC are split between these Harvesters every week. You can view Harvesters’ Mining Power and MAGIC production here: https://bridgeworld.treasure.lol/harvesters/leaderboard

The “Mining Power” of each Harvester fluctuates constantly and can be increased by staking various “Booster” NFTs and burning Zeeverse Items, here are their effects:
Staking Zees

Players can stake up to 6 Zees. Staking Zee boosts the size of your deposits, giving you a bigger share of rewards within the Harvester. Boosts stack additively, not multiplicatively. For instance, if you stake 3 Zee, you boost your deposit by (1 + 10% + 14% + 12%) = 1.36x and increase your share of rewards in the Harvester.
Deposit Boost
The Zee's level determines the boost:

Ranging from ~5% for lvl 1 to ~20% for lvl 50 Zees.
Note: the on-chain mining boost for Zees' is periodically updated to reflect the Zees' level, so it may take some time to see mining boosts updates after levelling your Zee.
Browse Zees here:
https://app.treasure.lol/collection/zeeverse-zee
https://opensea.io/collection/zeeverse-zee

Metabolic Boosters
Harvest Boost: Each Metabolic Booster increases the Harvester’s mining power, benefiting everyone in the Harvester.
Small Metabolic Boosters: 20% boost.
Medium Metabolic Boosters: 25% boost.
Large Metabolic Boosters: 30% boost.
…Other more power Boosters exist, but are scarce and difficult to find around the Treasure ecosystem
A maximum of 10 Metabolic Boosters can be staked at a time. These are burned once staked. Boosts expire after 1~3 hrs (depending on the Booster.) Players must work together to maintain boosts and to keep their Harvester producing more $MAGIC.

Browse Metabolic Boosters here: https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables
Legions

Deposit Boost
Players can stake Legions for a Deposit Boost. Up to 40kg worth of Legions can be staked. The boost % are the same as original Harvesters and based on their rarity.

Browse Legions here:
https://app.treasure.lol/games/bridgeworld?tab=collections

Maintaining Emberwing — Corruption
A toxic substance “Corruption” gradually leaks into the Harvester over time, slowing down the Harvester’s ability to produce $MAGIC over time. Players can counteract this by burning Zeeverse items in the Harvester.

Approximately 666 CORR flows into each Harvester every hour (this can fluctuate depending on what happens in Bridgeworld’s Crypts). To counteract this, players can purge Corruption from their Harvester by burning Zeeverse items as offerings.
Players will also be able to use Balancer Crystals and Bridgeworld Prisms to purge corruption with the same effectiveness (just like other Harvesters).

When purging Corruption, “Malevolent Prisms” are sometimes dropped, which can later be used to forge ERC20 Corruption and sabotage enemy Harvesters, leading to more $MAGIC for your Harvester.
When Corruption levels are higher, the drop rates for Malevolent Prisms are also higher, as Zeeverse Items are absorbing more of this toxic substance.
For more details see: https://docs.bridgeworld.treasure.lol/gameplay/fighting-corruption

Controlling Corruption with Zee in Bridgeworld
Zee can play in Bridgeworld’s “Corruption Crypts” game which is a perpetual maze that periodically shifts and resets.

The goal is to reach the end destination where one of the Harvester tiles is located.
If they make it to the end of the maze, they start directing more Corruption to that particular Harvester (i.e attack it).
Then Zee can also turn their Malevolent Prisms (which are sometimes dropped when removing Corruption from Emberwing) into additional Corruption ERC20 for their wallet, which they can cast on enemy Harvesters to lower their Mining Power and $MAGIC emissions (which also increases Emberwing’s $MAGIC emissions)
You can read more about how the game works and how to play here: https://docs.bridgeworld.treasure.lol/gameplay/corruption/corruption-crypts

Forging Corruption
Each Zee can forge Corruption once per round if they reach the end of the maze before the map resets.
The amount of CORR the Zee will claim is 0.2% of the Corruption Forging Pool which grows over time at 5000 CORR per hour.
You can group Zee and legions into armies of 5 to batch play.
So for example, if a single Zee forges CORR when there is 2,000,000 Corruption in the Corruption Forging Pool, they will receive 4000 CORR, leaving 1,996,000 CORR in the pool (less for following players to claim).

The faster you finish the maze, the more CORR you forge.
Then players can work with their team and send CORR to other Harvesters to slow down their MAGIC emissions (which speeds up the Zeeverse Harvesters rewards indirectly)
The Crypts maze resets periodically after a percentage (approx 40%) of players reach the end of the maze (or after 7 days, whichever happens first).


### Shaman's Guide to Fishing & Cooking
Shamans from every corner have eagerly anticipated the moment when Waka enriches the waterways with fish ripe for the catching, cooking, and savoring. The Fishing & Cooking, the first pair of the nine skills finally arrives at Zeeverse.
Casting Off
Shamans have been finding fishing rods in Corn Loot Pods for a while. Though their purpose was initially a bit unclear (despite being somewhat obvious), it’s time to put them to use. To start your fishing journey in Zeeverse, you’ll need one of these rods, plus some Bait, which you can find from Dungeon 15 and onwards, and from The Forge.
Every Shaman begins at the Central Pond in the Zeeverse lobby, a spot where any rod will do. However, as you move to different fishing locations, each spot will have its own rod requirements. Central Pond works with any rod, but rarer, more challenging locations require higher-tier rods.
The more you fish, the better you get. As you gain experience, your fishing speed and proficiency increase, opening up new, more challenging areas to conquer.

On the Stick
Take your catch to the island’s bonfire and delve into Cooking! Novice chefs will quickly learn that perfection in cooking fish is an acquired skill — mishaps may occur, but as your cooking level ascends, so does your mastery, eventually ensuring that your fish never meet a burnt fate.
Packing for Battle
To leverage the fish in combat, Shamans must acquire a Travel Bag, found within Corn Loot Pods. This essential item allows the storage of two consumables, ready to be deployed in battle to rejuvenate your Zees.

How to acquire Corn Loot Pod
Mint them on our website using $VEE or ETH
Buy them in-game for 10,000 $VEE (Yep, we discounted them for 50%)
Get 3 free Corn Loot Pods when you mint a Seasonal Soul Shard
Or purchase them from our Discord Voxel store for 7,500 Voxels
This is just the beginning of your skilling journey in Zeeverse, and we’re keen to hear what you think. Share your experiences, thoughts, and anything else with us — we’re listening!

Day and night, life and death - all were bound together in a harmonious tapestry woven by the hands of cosmic forces.\n\nDuring the **Age of Serenity**, the Spirit Realm flowed seamlessly alongside the material world, like a gentle river merging with the vast ocean. Humans walked a sacred path, their steps guided by whispers from the other side. They could feel the presence of Gods in every rustling leaf, every glistening stream, and every star that adorned the night sky.\n\nBut, as with all things, change was inevitable. A shadow fell upon this harmonious era, threatening to shatter the delicate equilibrium held by the universe. Corrupted Gods - forces unseen and powerful began to tip the scales. They initiated the division of the Spiritual and Material worlds, wreaking havoc upon the natural order. And so, the Age of Rupture began.\n\nAs the cycles unfolded, the greedy depleted their land's resources - exhausting rivers of their fish and forests of their timber, without any regard of moderation. And in a last-ditch effort to extend their existence, the Corrupted Gods ruptured the fabric of the Spirit Realm to usher in the **Age of Corruption**.\n\nYou begin as a young Shaman - summoned to the Spirit Realm in a desperate call for help. For centuries, Shamans have faithfully served as intermediaries between humanity and the Gods. Now, it falls upon you to restore the delicate balance between the two Realms of existence, ensuring the unbroken continuity of the eternal cycle.\n\nAre you up for the task?\n\n[PreviousIntroduction](/)\n[NextYour Journey](/lore/your-journey)\n\nLast updated 8 months ago"

The sacred world whose whispers guided you these years. Right in front of your eyes...\n\nBright, vibrant colors. Mountains whose peaks evaporate among the clouds and waterfalls that reach beyond the sun. You peek across the ledge and.... it's flying? Well, no wonder the Elders referred to it as the _Sky World_. But you just can't believe it's been here all along.\n\nBut, it's the _Age of Corruption_. The ancient truth of balance has been long forgotten, with only mere fragments of it remaining. And it is up to you to rediscover it.\n\nThe journey will not be an easy one. The forces of Corruption will resist - they have taken over much of the Spirit Realm already. As you confront the looming threat, prepare to face their influence within your soul and to defend against their relentless assaults within their Dungeon sanctuaries.\n\nKeep in mind, such battle is not one you can fight alone. You shall require allies, companions in this perilous journey. Embrace the Guardian Spirits known as [Zee](/gameplay/zee)\n; nurture their strength, for their power reflects your own.\n\nAs you journey through the Realms, you'll encounter Zee in various forms, each possessing unique abilities and personalities. Some may be fierce and protective, while others may be gentle and wise. It is in your interactions with them that you will form deep spiritual bonds that even the strongest adversaries shall not break, unless... you choose to break them yourself.\n\nThe Zee manifest in three primal elements: Water, Fire, and Grass, each with its own unique strengths and traits. However, ancient legends whisper of Zee of untold diversity, nestled within dormant eggs, awaiting the emergence of brave souls willing to uncover their mysteries and harness their potential.\n\n[PreviousInitiation](/lore/initiation)\n[NextGods](/lore/gods)\n\nLast updated 8 months ago"

        "markdown": "Clear your mind, Shaman, and listen closely, for whispers shall guide your every move.\n\nIn the _Age of Serenity_, those whispers were all that could be heard. The voices of the Gods of Chaos and Order harmonized in a delicate balance, a symphony of wisdom that enveloped the world.\n\nIn those times, it was understood that to walk the true path was to heed both voices - to dance upon the razor's edge of balance. To forsake one completely, for the other would eventually lead to one's own downfall.\n\nYou hear them now? Good.\n\nThe Gods of Chaos - they whisper of spontaneity, impulse, and hunger.\n\nThe Gods of Order.... they speak of structure, stability and perseverance.\n\nIt is a delicate dance, a cosmic conversation that echoes in your soul. But be warned, for in the pursuit of balance, one must tread with utmost care, as indulgence in either may lead to a path of Corruption you must beware.\n\nTo heed only the Gods of Order is to be consumed by rigidity, stifling growth and creativity. Conversely, surrendering solely to the Gods of Chaos will lead to a destructive way that will consume you in your entirety. That includes everything and everyone around you.\n\nHowever, the exact point of equilibrium, that is universally unknown, it lies within the journey you must undertake, discovering it all on your own. In the Spirit Realm, the Gods are in constant discord among themselves, so expect them to both aid and obstruct your path.\n\nYet, never presume that ones are entirely benevolent or otherwise, as they are nothing but two facets of the same reality.\n\n[PreviousYour Journey](/lore/your-journey)\n[NextSoul Keepers](/lore/soul-keepers)\n\nLast updated 8 months ago"

Their forms were a mesmerizing fusion of serene elegance and wild unpredictability, and they traversed galaxies, maintaining the sacred balance of the dual nature of the universe.\n\nHowever, a shroud of mystery clouds the fate of these mystical beings.\n\n_Whispers_ in the wind speak of a time when the Corrupt Gods, in their insatiable consumption, wrought a cataclysmic event that silenced the Soul Keepers from existence, leaving behind only fragments of their once majestic presence.\n\nExcept for one. A lone Soul Keeper whose essence was crystallized into an unbreakable gem, and yet, with the help of your fellow Shamans, he is now free.\n\nIn the Age of Corruption, to truly make a difference, you must acquire in your possession a [Soul Shard](/economy/nft-assets/soul-shards-erc-721s)\n - a mere fragment of what once was, but... a glimmer of hope, nonetheless.\n\nIt shall grant you enlightenment, enough to truly embark on your journey - to walk the path the Gods have set out for you.

But as the Age of Divergence unfolded, humans split into three tribes, each claiming to have recovered the full Truth as revealed by Gods.\n\nA time of temporal conflict unfolded, alliances between the Nations were formed as easily as they were broken, but there was never true peace. Even in times of relative calm, skirmishes happened on the borderlands.\n\n### \n\n\n\nChayara\n\nPerched atop the scorching Fire Mountains, the Chayara Nation were keepers of courage and innovation. Their grand guardian Spirit of the Hawk bestowed upon them an unparalleled master of fire and tools.\n\nIt was the Chayara who first harnessed the flames, illuminating not only their mountaintop abode, but the path of progress for the entirety of Humanity. Their tools were sharp, and their bold audacity won them many great victories.\n\nYet, their audacious creativity ultimately exposed them to a relentless barrage of hardships, chipping away at their resilience bit by bit.\n\n### \n\n\n\nSinoru\n\nIn the sprawling wetlands below, the Sinoru Nation flourished along rivers and lakes. Their guardian, the Whale Spirit, brought wisdom and tranquility, teaching them the art of fishing and peaceful existence.\n\nThe Sinoru\u2019s waters were home to mystical fish that bestowed knowledge, nourishing both the body and mind. In their world of satiated hunger, and communal contemplation they thought they had reached true balance, yet\u2026 they could rarely take their ways further than the confines of their territories.\n\nThe Sinoru had very little desire or capacity to adapt to the conditions of other lands, and so rather than adapting to the land, they tried to change the land itself.\n\n### \n\n\n\nTakanuwa\n\nBeyond the lakes, in the shadow of the dense forest, the Takanuwa Nation dwelled. Guided by the Snake Spirit, they had learned the secrets of the earth and embraced the cycles of change and rebirth. Through herbalism and farming, the Takanuwa nurtured the land, ensuring growth and transformation.\n\nAnd yet... they kept their greatest secrets even among themselves. There was significant internal rivalry among the Takanuwa: Shamans would not pass down their revelations to the next generation, and warband leaders would make great efforts not to reveal the best paths to their fellow tribesmen, fearing they might fall into enemy hands, or lead someone else than themselves to glory.\n\n[PreviousSoul Keepers](/lore/soul-keepers)\n[NextBasics](/gameplay/basics)\n\nLast updated 7 months ago"

Voxels will be used to develop various structures, from aesthetic to functional, such as Bank Vaults, Totem Poles, and various skilling stations. These different structures will require a variety of Voxels, encouraging players and Tribes to strategize and cooperate to collaboratively progress through Zeeverse.\n\nMining in Voxel Mines involves extracting Voxels from Voxel Blocks, with **the capacity of the Mine depending on the Land Grade**.\\* As Mining advances, the Voxel Mine\u2019s level increases, which in turn makes Voxel extraction progressively more difficult.\n\n**The extraction power of a Shaman will be directly linked to the power of their staked Zee**. In scenarios where multiple players have staked their Zees in a Mine, the extraction process employs a raffle system to allocate extracted Voxel Block to one player, with each player\u2019s staked Zee power influencing their chances of winning. Block progress is updated every minute, and **Master Chiefs can put taxes on their Mines, earning a share of the Voxels mined from Blocks.**\n\nVoxel Mining essentially converts players\u2019 invested time in game into Voxels to be traded or used on blueprints. While Zees are working, they are not available in battle, meaning no Zee will never need to sit idle in an inventory. As Shamans will also be able to contribute their Zees to Voxel Mines from other Lands, a collaborative environment is fostered.\n\n![](\n\n[PreviousResources](/lands/resources)\n[NextBlessings](/lands/blessings)\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"
